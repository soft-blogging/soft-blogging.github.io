        "title": "Verthash Miner 0.7.2 - Download, Set up  - Guide (2022)",
        "excerpt":"               VerthashMiner: how to install and running, command line arguments.          The Complete Guide to Configuring Verthashminer Version 0.7.2 and Newer.   Download for Windows/Linux   Download from GitHub       What is VerthashMiner?     VerthashMiner is a high performance GPU miner for the Verthash algorithm. The release of the open source program was made possible by the Vertcoin project and its community. Developer: CryptoGraphics. The implementations of Stratum, WorkIO and GBT are based in part on cpuminer-multi and lyclMiner.     Verthash Miner is an official open source miner for Windows and Linux with no commission for developers. It works on almost any graphics card from AMD, Nvidia and Intel.     Supported Hardware      AMD GPU GCN 1.0 or newer.   NVIDIA graphics card with Compute Power 3.0 or later.   (Some compute versions may require different miner builds for the CUDA backend. For example, version 8.0 requires CUDA 11.0, which excludes support for 3.0.).   In addition, the miner requires a video card with 2 GB of video memory or higher (depends on the WorkSize parameter).   Supported Platforms      AMD: OpenCL 1.2+ from AMD Radeon Software driver on Windows. AMDGPU-Pro and ROCm on Linux.   NVIDIA: OpenCL 1.2+ and CUDA are supported via a proprietary driver.   Mesa Gallium Compute and macOS are not supported.    How to set up VerthashMiner  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the miner  \t\t  Download the latest release from the official VerthashMiner GitHub repository.      Go to the Releases section on GitHub.       In the Assets drop-down list, find the latest version of the program.   Extract the downloaded archive. Better to use WinRAR to extract the archive.            \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Configure VerthashMiner  \t\t \t\t After unpacking the archive, you need to create new .bat files or edit existing ones. These files will store your program launch configuration.       Note: the Verthash algorithm requires a special file - verthash.dat, which can be obtained from external sources or generated by the miner using the following command:   verthashminer.exe --gen-verthash-data verthash.dat   Therefore, first you need to run the generate_verthash_data.bat file and wait for this file to be generated. This may take some time. The file weighs about 1.2 GB.  You will see the message \"This may take a while ...\" in the console. Wait for the inscription: \"Verthash data file has been generated!\"        Next, in the same folder as verthashminer.exe, you will need to create a file with the extension .bat. You can also just edit the existing .bat file.   If you want to create a new .bat file, first create a file with the extension .txt and change it to the extension .bat.   Open your .bat file with Notepad or Notepad ++ (which is more convenient). Below is an example configuration for a ZergPool. You need to enter the following commands into it:   VerthashMiner -u Vnhysez7nkJh9seeXjQevRjKVJUzxbaNn2 -p c=VTC,mc=VTC -o stratum+tcp://verthash.asia.mine.zergpool.com:4534 --all-cl-devices --all-cu-devices   At the very beginning of the line is the command -u Vnhysez7nkJh9seeXjQevRjKVJUzxbaNn2.   Instead of Vnhysez7nkJh9seeXjQevRjKVJUzxbaNn2 just enter your Vertcoin wallet address.   Do not forget to specify in the .bat file the path to the verthash.dat file generated in the step above.   Example: --verthash-data C:\\VerthashMiner\\verthash.dat   You should get the following (our program is located on disk C):   VerthashMiner -u Vnhysez7nkJh9seeXjQevRjKVJUzxbaNn2 -p c=VTC,mc=VTC -o stratum+tcp://verthash.asia.mine.zergpool.com:4534 --all-cl-devices --all-cu-devices --verthash-data C:\\VerthashMiner\\verthash.dat pause   \t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Start the miner  \t The third step is to launch the program.   Attention! Do not run verthashminer.exe. You must run the .bat file.  It is your .bat file or configuration file that gives the program information about your wallet and mining pool.   After starting the miner for a few minutes, you will see a console window with a hash rate:      \t \t   \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tHow to mine Vertcoin - Tutorial (Miner/Pool/OC setup)  \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Please note that creating the verthash.dat file is time consuming and can take about 10 minutes when using VerthashMiner on an Intel Core-i5 6500T quad-core processor with SATA SSD. The good news is thatyou only need to generate a data file and then when you run the program with normal command line parameters it just downloads the .DAT file and starts mining.          How to mining with 3 gb GPU vram - Vertcoin on zergpool  This video will show you how to mine vertcoin using the nvidia 3GB gpu. which will be converted into Dogecoin.        &nbsp;   Config file   All miner settings can also be controlled through the configuration file. As in the [lyclMiner] program (https://github.com/CryptoGraphics/lyclMiner).      Create a config file.            The configuration file can be generated. Create a file GenerateConfig.bat in the same folder as VerthashMiner.exe with the following content:         VerthashMiner -g your_config_file.conf                       (For Linux) The config file can be generated using the following command inside cmd / terminal: ./VerthashMiner -g your_config_file.conf       Additional notes:                    A configuration file is created specifically for your GPU and driver settings.           The configuration file must be recreated every time you add / remove a new device from / to the PCIe slot.                            If you want to use NVIDIA graphics cards with an OpenCL backend when CUDA is available, then the configuration file must be generated with the --no-restrict-cuda option. Example: Bat (windows):                 VerthashMiner -g your_config_file.conf --no-restrict-cuda                                  (Linux):                  ./VerthashMiner -g your_config_file.conf --no-restrict-cuda                                                                                   Setting up the miner. Open the file your_config_file.conf with any text editor and edit the fields URL, Username, Password and CoinbaseAddress (for solo mining only) inside the Connection block. Additional notes:            It is recommended to configure BatchTimeMs and OccupancyPct [options] (# Static and adaptive WorkSize configuration) for each Device in order to get the best performance or responsiveness of the desktop.           Use VerthashMiner -c your_config_file.conf to start mining.            Alternative (Windows). Create a file Run.bat in the same folder as VerthashMiner.exe with the following content:         VerthashMiner -c your_config_file.conf                       Additional notes:       To use NVIDIA GPUs with OpenCL backend when CUDA is available:         VerthashMiner -c your_config_file.conf --no-restrict-cuda                           Note that in this case your_config_file.conf must also be generated using the --no-restrict-cuda command.

reinstalling the drivers for your video card. It is also possible that your video card is too old. When working with multiple cards, it is recommended to increase the virtual memory up to 64 GB.   Conclusion   The verdict on whether it is a possible direct competitor to Nicehash, Honeyminer, or even Betterhash has yet to be made. This profit switching miner is pretty simplified in its GUI. And honestly, it’s easy to start mining cryptocurrency.   There are many different coins that can be mined and switched between using NPlusminer, making it quite versatile and comparable to the Honey miner.   Thank you for reading to the end.

Download for Windows/Linux   Download from the official site Download from GitHub Download from Bitcointalk       What is LOLminer?     LOLminer is a software for mining multiple coins at the same time. The software was created by a developer with the nickname Lolliedieb (aka Wilke Trei)1. This program can mine cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, TON coin, Beam, Grin and Zelcash. Starting from version 1.43, the miner supports dual mining2.     This program works on AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards.     The developer fee3 is 0.7% for Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. The TON mining fee is 1%. See the table below for details.

Be sure to select the correct file for your operating system. If you are using Windows, select the ZIP file. For Linux, a file with the .tar.gz extension.       Go to GitHub in the downloads section - \"Releases\".     Choose the latest version for your OS. It is available in the \"Assets\" drop-down list. Unzip the downloaded archive. To unpack the archive, it is better to use WinRAR.          \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Set up LOLminer  \t\t \t\t After extracting the archive, you will see files with the extension .bat.       For example, for dual mining, use the file dual_mine_eth_ton_tonwales.bat.  To mine a single coin like Ethereum, use the mine_eth.bat file.   You need to change the .bat file and put your wallet addresses in it.  To do this, open the .bat file with any text editor. Even a standard Windows notepad will do.  Change the line WALLET and TONWALLET.   Instead of 0x5576999cc34c1c0030f28939444d6ba9cd6919c2 enter your Ethereum wallet address.  Below is the bat file setup:   @echo off  setlocal enableDelayedExpansion  Rem ################################# Rem ## Begin of user-editable part ## Rem #################################  set \"POOL=eu1.ethermine.org:4444\" set \"WALLET=0x5576999cc34c1c0030f28939444d6ba9cd6919c2.Worker\"  set \"TONPOOL=https://server1.whalestonpool.com\" set \"TONWALLET=EQDk8olXYxBsrxiKvZSQMO1-Jjmx9_e-yNjvePJ3dxHlnAwf\" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t set \"EXTRAPARAMETERS=\"  Rem ################################# Rem ##  End of user-editable part  ## Rem #################################  if exist \"%CD%\\lolMiner.exe\" goto infolder echo \"Searching for lolMiner.exe, because is not in this folder.That could take sometime...\" for /f \"delims=\" %%F in ('dir /b /s \"C:\\lolMiner.exe\" 2^&gt;nul') do set MyVariable=%%F if exist \"%MyVariable%\" goto WindowsVer echo \"lolMiner.exe is not found in the system, that could be blocked by Windows Defender or Antivirus \" goto END  :infolder set MyVariable=%CD%\\lolMiner.exe  :WindowsVer echo \"Running lolMiner from %MyVariable%\" for /f \"tokens=4-5 delims=. \" %%i in ('ver') do set VERSION=%%i.%%j if \"%version%\" == \"10.0\" goto W10 goto OtherW  :W10 \"%MyVariable%\" --algo ETHASH --pool !POOL! --user !WALLET! --dualmode TONDUAL --dualpool !TONPOOL! --dualuser !TONWALLET! !EXTRAPARAMETERS! --watchdog exit timeout 10 goto W10 goto END  :OtherW \"%MyVariable%\" --algo ETHASH --pool !POOL! --user !WALLET! --dualmode TONDUAL --dualpool !TONPOOL! --dualuser !TONWALLET! !EXTRAPARAMETERS! --watchdog exit --nocolor timeout 10 goto OtherW  :END pause   Only part of this code needs to be changed. Nothing else needs to be changed:         \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Run the miner  \t The final step is to run lolminer. Double click on the .bat file you modified in the second step. You have successfully configured the program on the Ethermine pool. In the article below there will be a setting for other operating systems.  You will see this CMD in Windows:       This console displays the current mining status. To stop Lolminer you just need to close this window.

You can configure the configuration both in the .bat file and in the lolminer.cfg file.   Settings example:    Config   algo algo=ETHASH   pool pool=eu1.ethermine.org:4444   user (wallet address) user=0x5576999cc34c1c0030f28939444d6ba9cd6919c2     The configuration file looks like this:   # lolMiner configuration # uncomment a line (remove the starting \"#\") to set an option  # in this file # The available options are the same as in the command line # See readme.txt to get a list of available options     #################################################################### # Required Options ####################################################################  algo=ETHASH pool=eu1.ethermine.org:4444 user=0x5576999cc34c1c0030f28939444d6ba9cd6919c2  #################################################################### # Comfort functions ####################################################################  # apiport=&lt;the port to open api&gt; # shortstats=&lt;interval between the short statiscics&gt; # longstats=&lt;interval between the verbose statiscics&gt;   You can run the config using the .bat file:   lolMiner.exe --config lolMiner.cfg pause   The second way to run the configuration is to run lolMiner.exe directly.   Commands and options   This software uses a wide range of commands. Most of them are required to complete the basic mining setup. Others are optional and not necessarily useful for your mining rig.   List of main commands:      --coin - specify the name of the coin you want to mine.   –-pool - specify the address of the desired pool, for example, eu1.ethermine.org.   --port - specify the port of the pool, for example 4444.   --user - specify the address of your wallet and the name of your worker (worker name). These two values ​​must be separated by a dot, eg wallet.RIG01.   --pass - specify the pool password. By default, this value is x - no password. This is because most do not have a password.   worker name is the name of your mining rig. It can be absolutely anything, like MyAwesomeRTX or just MyWorker or RIG01. However, it is undesirable to use special characters and apostrophes. This can lead to syntax errors in your settings.   &nbsp;          Dual mine eth and alph on Hiveos  Network difficulty is going up way too much on ALPH, my 2GH/s are yielding less and less coins. Also one pool is owning almost 70% of the network hash-rate, people never learn, it's so boring.

You can also create shortcuts to pre-written string configurations using a batch (.bat file) file on Windows, or bash script on linux.   Subscribe to cryptosoft.download.   Releases   1.51   1.50      On dual mining the LHR cards will now behave live full hash rate cards. This means dual mining tuning will start approximately 1 Minute after the DAG build is completed.   1.48      Slightly improved initial speed after working with 510.x and 512.x drivers, allowing you to reach maximum performance faster.   Improved LHR Unblocker’s resilience to small workload changes. We always recommend that you do not load the card with anything other than mining during the calibration phase - once this is completed, the miner will become more reliable.   Cards with full hashrate disable LHR detection no later than one minute after the --lhrwait expires. This means that, by default, one minute after DAG creation, maps are now “protected” from further detection.   Added Nvidia core temperature transition reading.   Configuration change to improve convenience: if the number of entries for --cclk, --mclk, --lhrtune or --maxdualimpact exactly matches the number of selected GPUs, the miner now automatically skips idle devices. For example, --devices 1,2,4 --cclk 1050,1400,1500 now makes sense, while --cclk ,1050,1400,,1500 was previously required to skip unused devices. --lhrtune 0 is now semantically identical to --lhrtune off   Changed handling of usernames/wallets containing one or more periods. This should solve the problems with renting a mining farm and an ezil pool. Note. Some pools may not like adding a dot to the username. If yes and get denied authorization, use --worker.   Fixed LHR unlock not working when many GPUs required DAG recovery during Aleph dual mining (yes, this is a special case…)   Fixed RTX 3050 and RTX 3080 12GB with extremely low Ethash performance during dual mining.   Fixed an issue where the dual mining hashrate on FHR cards was not displayed when calibrating dual mining in version 1.47   Fixed an issue where --lhrtune off would sometimes not work in version 1.47.   1.47   1.45                       BeamHash III POW interview with Wilke Trei (aka Lolliedieb). &#8617;                  Developer’s note on extending the ability to run the miner with two user connections compared to earlier versions. &#8617;                  Source: Official release on GitHub. &#8617;           ","categories": ["miners"],

There we will find files to download. At the very top of the page, we will see the latest version for Windows, as well as the latest version for Linux. GitHub also describes to us what updates this software implements.          Choose the correct file for your operating system. If you are using Windows, select the ZIP file. For Linux, a file with the .tar.gz extension. There are usually no problems with the download, so no additional action is required.     Unzip the downloaded file. To unpack the archive, it is better to use WinRAR.       \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Set up T Rex Miner  \t\t \t\t One of the good things about T-Rex Miner is that it has separate .bat files depending on the pool and the type of currency we are going to mine.  After extracting the archive, you will see files with type windows batch file.       This greatly simplifies the setup process. We only need to access the pool that interests us the most. Then you need to change the necessary credentials (`wallet_address` or `pool_login`) to start mining.    For dual mining, use the file ETH+ZIL-ezil.bat. To unlock LHR in dual mining use files LHR-unlock-dual-ETH+RVN.bat. To mine a single coin like Ethereum, use the file ETH+ZIL-ezil.bat.    In this example, we used the configuration for thought mining Ethereum and ZIL on Ethermine Pool. Here are the steps:    We are looking for the cryptocurrency we want to mine in the folder, in our case, Ethereum + ZIL. Now we are looking for the appropriate mining pool - Ezil and Ethermine Pool. Click the right mouse button on the .bat file, and open it with Windows Notepad. A parameter line will appear in which we have to set up a few commands. First, this is the pool server we're connecting to. In our case, we can leave eu1.ethermine.org:4444 We are changing the wallet address in the -u command, which we have marked in green in the following image. Save the configuration and close.   Below is the bat file setup:   t-rex.exe -a ethash --coin eth+zil -o stratum+tcp://eu1.ethermine.org:4444 -u 0x5576999cc34c1c0030f28939444d6ba9cd6919c2 --url2 stratum+ssl://eu.ezil.me:25443 --user2 0x5576999cc34c1c0030f28939444d6ba9cd6919c2.zil134ynwcs9nl2asnvn7ac03ul35jymegzxzp2gzm.WORKER --extra-dag-epoch 0 pause   So, change the line after -u and --user2.   Instead of 0x5576999cc34c1c0030f28939444d6ba9cd6919c2 enter your Ethereum wallet address.   Only part of this code needs to be changed. Nothing else needs to be changed:       WORKER is what comes after the dot is the name of the miner which we will see on the Ethermine pool site.      \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Run the miner  \t Now double click on the .bat file and the mining process will start.  You will see this CMD in Windows:       This console shows the current mining status. To stop Trex miner, you just need to close this window.

NVIDIA introduced this measure to prevent the use of gaming graphics cards for mining. Theoretically, this limitation is software-firmware and operates according to several algorithms. Mining software can bypass LHR blocking and increase the hash rate.   An example of unlocking LHR for dual mining ETH and RVN:   t-rex.exe -a ethash --lhr-algo kawpow -o stratum+tcp://ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 -u username1 -p x -w rig0 --url2 stratum+tcp://rvn.2miners.com:6060 --user2 RKzUGLFtdMUQgCstmufnWamA5RwN74yHU8.rig0 --pass2 x pause   Config   The second way to configure is to use configuration files. You can configure the configuration both in the .bat file and in the trexminer.cfg file. To start the T-Rex with the config.txt configuration file, type in the console: t-rex -c config.txt.   Use the config_example file as a starting point for creating your own configuration.   If the option is set in the configuration file and also via the cmd line, the latter takes precedence, for example:   t-rex -c config.txt -w &lt;worker_name_to_override_the_one_in_config_file&gt;   You can also use environment variables: just put %YOUR_ENV_VAR% anywhere in your config file and it will be automatically set to the value of YOUR_ENV_VAR at runtime.   Settings example:                  Parameter       Example                       algo       \"algo\": \"kawpow\",                 pool       \"url\": \"stratum+tcp://rvn.2miners.com:6060\",                 user (wallet address)       \"user\": \"RKzUGLFtdMUQgCstmufnWamA5RwN74yHU8\",                 Worker       \"worker\": \"%HOSTNAME%_rig0\"           As with a .bat file, correct syntax is important for the configuration. This means that all commas, spaces, quotation marks and other characters must be strictly observed.   The configuration file looks like this:   {   // List of main and failover pools   \"pools\": [     {       \"user\": \"RKzUGLFtdMUQgCstmufnWamA5RwN74yHU8\", // wallet address (change it)       \"url\": \"stratum+tcp://rvn.2miners.com:6060\", // pool url       \"pass\": \"x\", // password       \"worker\": \"%HOSTNAME%_rig0\" // worker name     },     {       \"user\": \"RKzUGLFtdMUQgCstmufnWamA5RwN74yHU8\",       \"url\": \"stratum+tcp://stratum.ravenminer.com:3838\", // failover pool url       \"pass\": \"x\"     }   ],        // Name of mining algorithm.

If the pool requires a login instead, then specify it.   --worker - specify the name of your worker (worker name). For example, --worker RIG01.   --pass - specify the pool password. By default, this value is x - no password. This is because most do not have a password.   worker name is the name of your mining rig. It can be absolutely anything, like RTX3060 or just Worker1 or RIG01. However, special characters and apostrophes are not recommended. This may cause syntax errors in the settings.   &nbsp;          T-Rex Miner Tutorial + LHR Dual Mining Revisited with Profitability (Win 10)  We will also revisit the LHR Dual Mining Unlock for Ethereum &amp; Ravencoin, as since my previous video I discovered it is extremely sensitive to the power limit.          &nbsp;   Commands for dual mining   With dual mining, two coins are mined simultaneously in different pools of your choice. Coins do not have to have the same algorithm.   Available algorithms for dual mode:     Ethash (Ethereum) + blake3   Ethash + Kawpow (Ravencoin)   Ethash + octopus (Conflux Network)   Ethash + autolykos2 (ergo)   Ethash + firopow (firo)   GPU miners can benefit from the fact that some algorithms are memory intensive (eg ethash) while others are core intensive (eg blake3). This allows you to combine algorithms and mine a second coin with very little impact on the hashrate of the first algorithm.   Dual mining can be enabled with the --dual-algo option, which should be preferred to the deprecated --lhr-algo.   Below are examples.   ETH + Alephium (ALPH), Blake3 dual algorithm   Quick start: see the file LHR-unlock-dual-ETH+ALPH *.bat/*.sh in miner archive.   If you are using HiveOS or any other mining OS that runs T-Rex with a config file instead of command line arguments, you need to specify your options in JSON.   Example:   \"dual-algo\": \"blake3\" \"url2\": \"stratum+tcp://pool.woolypooly.com:3106\" \"user2\": \"14xchBfD4bwxdti44NyjK5BQWympyHuxAREigL2UkZCgZ\" \"pass2\": \"x\"   The above will set blake3 as the second algo in dual mining mode.   Performance tuning   There are several options for fine-tuning the performance of video cards depending on how they perform dual mining. See options below:      --dual-algo-mode &lt;algo&gt;:&lt;tuning factor&gt;    &lt;algo&gt; can be one of the following:     a1 - GPU will mine only the main algorithm (ETH)   a2 - The GPU will only mine the secondary algorithm (the one you set in --dual-algo)   a12 - GPU will mine both algorithms at the same time (double mining)   &lt;tuning factor&gt; is optional and can be one of the following:     rXX is the “double ratio” factor set to XX. The following equation illustrates what a “double ratio” is: &lt;double ratio&gt; = &lt;secondary algorithm hashrate&gt; / &lt;primary algorithm hashrate&gt; (the formula gets a bit more complicated for LHR maps, but that’s the point). This coefficient is displayed in the console shortly after the start of mining.   hXX - percentage of the hashrate of the main algorithm XX% (only applies to cards without LHR).   The default value for --dual-algo-mode is a12 which means all GPUs will mine in dual mode with default settings.   Non-LHR graphics cards will attempt to support 98% of the main algorithm’s maximum hashrate, and LHRs will unlock LHR up to 74, unless the LHR setting values ​​are explicitly set to a different value.      --profit-per-mh &lt;profit_algo1&gt;:&lt;profit_algo2&gt;    &lt;profit_algo1&gt; is the amount in dollars (or any other currency) that you expect to earn from the main algorithm at a rate of 1MH/s. You can get this information from the online mining calculator.   &lt;profit_algo2&gt; - the same for the secondary algorithm.   If you haven’t explicitly set the dual ratio, this setting will cause the miner to compare different “double ratios” at startup and choose the one that gives the most profit. This feature is only applicable to non-LHR cards.   Your LHR cards will dual mine according to the specified LHR setting values.   Example  Consider the following set of options, assuming they are part of the ETH+ALPH configuration:   --dual-algo-mode a2,a1,a12,a12:r15,a1,a12:h95,a12 --lhr-tune 0,74,73,0,0,0,0 --profit-per-mh 0.0516:0.0012  Этот конфиг преоббразуется в следующее:   GPU#0: non-LHR, mines ALPH   GPU#1: LHR, mines ETH with LHR 74   GPU#2: LHR, mines ETH+ALPH with LHR 73   GPU#3: non-LHR, mines ETH+ALPH with dual ratio 15   GPU#4: non-LHR, mines ETH   GPU#5: non-LHR, mines ETH+ALPH with ETH hashrate being approximately 95% of its max value in single mode   GPU#6: non-LHR, mines ETH+ALPH with dual ratio that maximises profitability based on the data set in `--profit-per-mh` (ETH expected profit is $0.0516/MH, ALPH - $0.0012/MH)   (ETH expected profit is $0.0516/MH, ALPH - $0.0012/MH)   Tips      Due to its nature, dual mining is very energy intensive, so if you want to maximize the hashrate of the secondary algorithm, try increasing the power limit.   An even better way would be to leave the maximum power limit and instead lock the core clock for graphics cards that support it.      Don’t forget to restart the miner after changing overclock settings.   &nbsp;          ETH and Alephium Dual Mining  Hive OS extra config Arguments (copy &amp; paste then update to yours):    \"worker\": \"%WORKER_NAME%\" \"coin\":\"%COIN%\"  \"lhr-algo\": \"blake3\" \"url2\": \"us2.alephium.herominers.com:1199\" \"user2\": \"WALLET.WorkerName1\" \"pass2\": \"password\"         &nbsp;   Overclocking Options   What is the difference between --lock-cclock and --cclock?      --lock-cclock sets the core clock to an absolute value.   --cclock is an offset (+/-) from how overclocking works normally.   --lock-cclock manages power to keep the core clock where you set it.   --cclock does not control power, so you will need to use the --pl setting to set the power limit.   --lock-cclock and --cclock are mutually exclusive. Therefore, use only one command if you are using both commands on a multi-card rig (eg: --lock-cclock 0,1200 --cclock 100,0).   Supported algorithms   The list of algorithms can be found below:     autolykos2   blake3   etchash   ethash   firopow   kawpow   mtp   mtp-tcr   multi   octopus   progpow   progpow-veil   progpow-veriblock   progpowz   tensority   Настройка для RaveOS          How to Mine Ravencoin with RaveOS  Optimal OC settings vary from card to card.  No two silicon chips are created equal so you'll need to experiment dialling your overclock up and down in increments until the hash rate won't rise any further.         &nbsp;   Troubleshooting   how to disable one video card   To disable a video card, add the -d command followed by the bus number of the video card in the system. This command is added to the batch file.   the -d command includes the graphics card, not excludes it, so specify the number of the card you want to use with -d. And don’t list the ones you want to exclude.   Examples:   -d 0   Or   -d 1   Etc.   For HiveOS, you can choose as follows:   \"devices\": \"0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\"   Conclusion   Who wants to build an Ethereum mining farm with NVIDIA graphics cards, the best solution is T-Rex Miner.

There you will find files for download. At the very top of the page, we will see the latest version for Windows as well as the latest version for Linux.         Choose the correct file for your operating system. If you are using Windows, select the ZIP file. For Linux, a file with the .tar.xz extension.     Extract the downloaded file. To unpack the archive, it is better to use WinRAR.       \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Set up Gminer  \t\t \t\t  After extracting the archive, you will see files with type windows batch file.       You need to enter your mining addresses into these files.    For dual mining, use mine_eth+ton.bat. To mine a single coin like Ethereum, use the file Ethereum-ethermine.bat.    In this guide, we used the setup of dual mining Ethereum and TON on the pool Ethermine Pool. Here are the steps:     We are looking for the cryptocurrency we want to mine in the folder. In our case, this is Ethereum + TON. Looking for a suitable mining pool: Ton Whalestonpool and Ethermine Pool. Click right on the .bat file and open it with Windows Notepad. A parameter line will appear in which we have to configure various commands. The first one is the pool server we are connecting to. In our case, we can leave eu1.ethermine.org:4444 In the --user command, we change the Ethereum wallet address, which we have marked in green in the following image. In the --duser command, we change the address of the TON coin wallet, which we marked in red in the following image. Save the configuration and run the file you edited.        Get wallets on cryptocurrency exchange.     Below is the bat file setup:    miner.exe --algo ethash --server eth.2miners.com:2020 --user 0x5576999cc34c1c0030f28939444d6ba9cd6919c2 --dalgo ton --dserver wss://eu1.stratum.ton-pool.com/stratum --duser EQDk8olXYxBsrxiKvZSQMO1-Jjmx9_e-yNjvePJ3dxHlnAwf   So, change the line after --user and --duser.   Instead of 0x5576999cc34c1c0030f28939444d6ba9cd6919c2 enter your Ethereum wallet address. Instead of EQDk8olXYxBsrxiKvZSQMO1-Jjmx9_e-yNjvePJ3dxHlnAwf enter the TON address.   Only part of this code needs to be changed. Nothing else needs to be changed:    \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Run the miner  \t Double-click the .bat file. Strategizes the mining process.  You will see the following cmd window on Windows:        This console shows the current mining status. To stop the miner, you just need to close this window.

Download Nbminer  \t\t To get started, you first need to download the miner. Check the GitHub page for the most recent version. You can also download the release from the official site.          Then extract the contents to a folder added to the Windows exclusion list. This is an important step because Windows may see it as a threat or virus and will try to remove it. To add a miner to the exclusion list, see this post.        \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2. Choose an algorithm and edit the bat file for dual mining  \t\t \t\t  After extracting all files and adding them to the exclusion list, you will need to select a bat file to run. They are listed by algorithm and have the extension .bat.       In this example, we are going to edit \"Dual Eth+Zil.bat\" which is the ethash algorithm for dual mining Ethereum and Zilliqa.    In this guide, we used the Ethereum and Zilliqa dual mining setup on the Ezil pool. Here are the steps:   Now that we've chosen an algorithm, we're ready to edit the batch file and paste in our data. Don't skip this step. By entering your information, you will verify that you are paid for the work of your miner.  You can edit the file by right-clicking and selecting \"Edit\" from the menu. It is recommended to use Notepad or Notepad++ as the editor. You should see the following text file when it is open.      The batch file has three areas that we want to change with our own settings. The first will be \"Pool\".  In this example, we are going to use ezil.me as our pool. You can use any pool you choose. When you go to the ezil.me site, it will give you information about the pool. You will select a mining server called \"eu.ezil.me\", add a colon and then add its port which is \"25443\".   Upon completion, you should make sure that the settings are correct: stratum+ssl://eu.ezil.me:25443.   The next step is to enter your wallet address. Since in this example we are mining Ethereum + Zilliqa, we need to specify the wallet address from Ethereum and the second coin. If you don't have a wallet yet, you can install Trust Wallet, Metamask or Exodus to get one.   But an easier way is to get wallets on thecryptocurrency exchange..    Make sure you delete your current wallet addresses and enter your personal addresses. In the example, first comes the ardes ETH 0x5576999cc34c1c0030f28939444d6ba9cd6919c2 then the dot . is required and the address of the second coin is entered - zil1x4j2tk87t650v3fym03adr9ph833g9ptrt6dn3    Below is the bat file setup:    nbminer -a ethash -o stratum+ssl://eu.ezil.me:25443 -u 0x5576999cc34c1c0030f28939444d6ba9cd6919c2.zil1x4j2tk87t650v3fym03adr9ph833g9ptrt6dn3.WORKER -log --enable-dag-cache pause    \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3. Run the miner  \t  Save your changes and you can now run the file by double clicking on the bat file we just edited.  You should see a command prompt window open.       Leave this window open to continue mining. Once you close the window, the mining session will end. Watch the video to create a more productive setup.  \t \t   \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tNBMiner Step-by-step Guide - Mining Software  \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     How to set up NBminer on the Binance pool   Make 4 settings:      ethash - specifies the name of the algorithm.   ethash.poolbinance.com - enter the pool address.   8888 - indicates the port of the pool.   username1 - enter the login from Binance Pool.        Example:   nbminer -a ethash -o ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 -u username1   &nbsp;          How to Connect NBMiner with Binance Pool to mine Ethereum  Nice step by step guide and very clear!        Watch the video.  &nbsp;   LHR  What is LHR in mining?   To successfully bypass LHR protection, you need to give the miner administrator rights. To do this, right-click the executable in the program folder and go to Properties        Check the box next to the item you want on the Compatibility tab.        Then run the bat file as administrator.        If the miner does not start, just run the bat file.          NBminer 100% LHR Unlock in HiveOS is Perfect  Run command in HiveOS was very handy to input the commands to update the nvidia driver and NBminer update        Watch the video.  &nbsp;   Commands   To use commands, choose either the long name: --algo or the short name: -a. Both commands should not be used. These are synonyms.   Example:   nbminer -a algo -o protocol+socket_type://pool_host:pool_port -u wallet_address.worker -p passwd   Commands for connecting to the pool      -a, --algo \\&lt;algo&gt; Select mining algorithm.   -o, --url \\&lt;url&gt; Mining pool URL.   -u, --user \\&lt;user&gt; The user used in the pool, wallet address or username.   -o1, --url1 \\&lt;url&gt; The URL for the backup pool pool 1.   -u1, --user1 \\&lt;user&gt; username for the backup pool pool 1.   -o2, --url2 \\&lt;url&gt; URL for backup pool pool 2.   -u2, --user2 \\&lt;user&gt; username for the backup pool pool 2.   -p, --password \\&lt;password&gt; password for the mining pool.   -p1, --password1 \\&lt;password&gt; password for backup pool1.   -p2, --password2 \\&lt;password&gt; password for backup pool2.   Commands for overclocking and power limit      --mt, --memory-tweak \\&lt;mode&gt; Memory timings are optimized for Nvidia GDDR5 and GDDR5X graphics cards. Range [1-6]. The higher the value, the higher the hashrate. An individual value can be set via a comma separated list. The power cap may need to be adjusted to get more hashrate.   A higher scrap rate can occur if the mining rig is exposed to high temperatures. Setting -mt to a lower value can reduce the scrap rate.   On Windows, you need to install a custom driver when using -mt, you can install it manually using the --driver option, or you can run nbminer.exe as administrator to perform an automatic installation.   On Linux, you need administrator privileges to run, sudo ./nbminer -mt x. OhGodAnETHlargementPill is no longer needed if -mt is enabled when mining on 1080 and 1080ti GPUs.           --driver \\&lt;action&gt; Windows only option, install/remove driver for memory tweak. Run with administrator rights.       installation: bminer.exe --driver install        uninstall: nbminer.exe --driver uninstall            --power-limit, --pl \\&lt;limit&gt; Set GPU power limit.            Set PL in watts: -pl 200.            Set PL as a percentage of the default PowerLimit: -pl 75%.            --cclock \\&lt;clocks&gt; Set the core clock in MHz.            Set kernel clock offsets: -cclock 100, -cclock -500 (Windows only).            Set locked core clock: -cclock @1500.            --mclock \\&lt;clocks&gt; Sets the memory clock offset in MHz. (only for Windows).       --lock-cv \\&lt;cv&gt; Set the locked core voltage in mV. (only for Windows).   Fan and temperature control      --temperature-limit, --tl \\&lt;temp-limit&gt; Set the GPU temperature limit, if it exceeds, stop the GPU.   --temperature-start, --ts \\&lt;temp-start&gt; Set target cooling temperature if GPU is stopped by --temperature-limit command, default \\&lt;temp-limit&gt; - 5.   --fan \\&lt;speed&gt; Set the GPU fan speed as a percentage. (only for Windows).   Select video card and devices      -d, --devices \\&lt;devices&gt; Specify a list of GPUs to use. Format: -d 0,1,2,3 to use the first 4 GPUs.   --platform \\&lt;platform&gt; Select a platform. Available values:   0: NVIDIA+AMD (default),   1: NVIDIA only,   2: AMD only.   --device-info Show cuda information about the device.   --device-info-json Show detailed information for each device in json format.   Intensity      -i, --intensity \\&lt;intensities&gt; A comma-separated list of intensities (1-100).   --cuckoo-intensity \\&lt;intensity&gt; Set intensity for cuckoo, cuckaroo, cuckatoo, [1, 12] algorithms.   Lower value means higher CPU usage to increase hash rate.   Setting 0 means automatic adaptation.   Default: 0.   Dual mining commands   nbminer -a ethash -o stratum+ssl://eu.ezil.me:25443 -u 0x5576999cc34c1c0030f28939444d6ba9cd6919c2.zil134ynwcs9nl2asnvn7ac03ul35jymegzxzp2gzm.WORKER -log --enable-dag-cache pause   Logs, error log           --log Create a log file named logs/log_&lt;timestamp&gt;.txt.            --log-file \\&lt;filename&gt; Generate a custom log file. Note. This option overrides --log.            --log-no-job Set this option to disable new job information in the console and log file.            --log-cycle \\&lt;loop&gt; Set to change the pivot table display cycle in console and log in seconds, default is 30.            --long-format Use yyMMdd HH:mm:ss,zzz for log time format.            --verbose Print communication data between minersm and pooled to a log file.       Watchdog      --no-watchdog Disable the watchdog process.   --no-health Do not query the health status of the device. (Do not install if using LHR GPU).   --no-color Don’t use colored output log in cmd line.   Configuration file      -c, --config \\&lt;path to configuration file&gt; Use json format configuration file, not cmd line options.   --generate-config \\&lt;filename&gt; Generate sample json configuration file.   Hashrate and income statistics           --fee \\&lt;fee&gt; Change devfee as a percentage, [0-5]. Set to 0 to disable development fees with lower hashrate. Otherwise devfee = max(set_value, default_value).            --share-check \\&lt;value&gt; If \\&lt;value&gt; minutes without shares, then restart the miner. Set to 0 to disable. Default: 30.            --no-interrupt set this option to make the miner not interrupt current GPU jobs when a new job comes from the pool, this will cause less power issue but may result in a slightly higher aging rate and share rejection.            --enable-igpu AMD igpu is disabled by default, enable this option.       Miscellaneous      -h, --help Display help.   -v, --version Display version information of the program.   --api \\&lt;host:port&gt; Endpoint for serving the REST API.   --strict-ssl Check the validity of the certificate when using an SSL connection.   --proxy The Socks5 proxy used to establish a connection to the pool, eg. 127.0.0.1:1080   Conclusion   Now that we’ve covered everything you need to know, feel free to share this guide with anyone you think would benefit from it!
