        "excerpt":"               VerthashMiner: how to install and running, command line arguments.          The Complete Guide to Configuring Verthashminer Version 0.7.2 and Newer.   Download for Windows/Linux   Download from GitHub       What is VerthashMiner?     VerthashMiner is a high performance GPU miner for the Verthash algorithm. The release of the open source program was made possible by the Vertcoin project and its community. Developer: CryptoGraphics. The implementations of Stratum, WorkIO and GBT are based in part on cpuminer-multi and lyclMiner.     Verthash Miner is an official open source miner for Windows and Linux with no commission for developers. It works on almost any graphics card from AMD, Nvidia and Intel.     Supported Hardware      AMD GPU GCN 1.0 or newer.   NVIDIA graphics card with Compute Power 3.0 or later.   (Some compute versions may require different miner builds for the CUDA backend. For example, version 8.0 requires CUDA 11.0, which excludes support for 3.0.).   In addition, the miner requires a video card with 2 GB of video memory or higher (depends on the WorkSize parameter).   Supported Platforms      AMD: OpenCL 1.2+ from AMD Radeon Software driver on Windows. AMDGPU-Pro and ROCm on Linux.   NVIDIA: OpenCL 1.2+ and CUDA are supported via a proprietary driver.   Mesa Gallium Compute and macOS are not supported.    How to set up VerthashMiner  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the miner  \t\t  Download the latest release from the official VerthashMiner GitHub repository.      Go to the Releases section on GitHub.       In the Assets drop-down list, find the latest version of the program.   Extract the downloaded archive. Better to use WinRAR to extract the archive.            \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Configure VerthashMiner  \t\t \t\t After unpacking the archive, you need to create new .bat files or edit existing ones. These files will store your program launch configuration.       Note: the Verthash algorithm requires a special file - verthash.dat, which can be obtained from external sources or generated by the miner using the following command:   verthashminer.exe --gen-verthash-data verthash.dat   Therefore, first you need to run the generate_verthash_data.bat file and wait for this file to be generated. This may take some time. The file weighs about 1.2 GB.  You will see the message \"This may take a while ...\" in the console. Wait for the inscription: \"Verthash data file has been generated!\"        Next, in the same folder as verthashminer.exe, you will need to create a file with the extension .bat. You can also just edit the existing .bat file.   If you want to create a new .bat file, first create a file with the extension .txt and change it to the extension .bat.   Open your .bat file with Notepad or Notepad ++ (which is more convenient). Below is an example configuration for a ZergPool. You need to enter the following commands into it:   VerthashMiner -u Vnhysez7nkJh9seeXjQevRjKVJUzxbaNn2 -p c=VTC,mc=VTC -o stratum+tcp://verthash.asia.mine.zergpool.com:4534 --all-cl-devices --all-cu-devices   At the very beginning of the line is the command -u Vnhysez7nkJh9seeXjQevRjKVJUzxbaNn2.   Instead of Vnhysez7nkJh9seeXjQevRjKVJUzxbaNn2 just enter your Vertcoin wallet address.   Do not forget to specify in the .bat file the path to the verthash.dat file generated in the step above.   Example: --verthash-data C:\\VerthashMiner\\verthash.dat   You should get the following (our program is located on disk C):   VerthashMiner -u Vnhysez7nkJh9seeXjQevRjKVJUzxbaNn2 -p c=VTC,mc=VTC -o stratum+tcp://verthash.asia.mine.zergpool.com:4534 --all-cl-devices --all-cu-devices --verthash-data C:\\VerthashMiner\\verthash.dat pause   \t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Start the miner  \t The third step is to launch the program.   Attention! Do not run verthashminer.exe. You must run the .bat file.  It is your .bat file or configuration file that gives the program information about your wallet and mining pool.   After starting the miner for a few minutes, you will see a console window with a hash rate:      \t \t   \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tHow to mine Vertcoin - Tutorial (Miner/Pool/OC setup)  \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Please note that creating the verthash.dat file is time consuming and can take about 10 minutes when using VerthashMiner on an Intel Core-i5 6500T quad-core processor with SATA SSD. The good news is thatyou only need to generate a data file and then when you run the program with normal command line parameters it just downloads the .DAT file and starts mining.          How to mining with 3 gb GPU vram - Vertcoin on zergpool  This video will show you how to mine vertcoin using the nvidia 3GB gpu. which will be converted into Dogecoin.        &nbsp;   Config file   All miner settings can also be controlled through the configuration file. As in the [lyclMiner] program (https://github.com/CryptoGraphics/lyclMiner).      Create a config file.            The configuration file can be generated. Create a file GenerateConfig.bat in the same folder as VerthashMiner.exe with the following content:         VerthashMiner -g your_config_file.conf                       (For Linux) The config file can be generated using the following command inside cmd / terminal: ./VerthashMiner -g your_config_file.conf       Additional notes:                    A configuration file is created specifically for your GPU and driver settings.           The configuration file must be recreated every time you add / remove a new device from / to the PCIe slot.                            If you want to use NVIDIA graphics cards with an OpenCL backend when CUDA is available, then the configuration file must be generated with the --no-restrict-cuda option. Example: Bat (windows):                 VerthashMiner -g your_config_file.conf --no-restrict-cuda                                  (Linux):                  ./VerthashMiner -g your_config_file.conf --no-restrict-cuda                                                                                   Setting up the miner. Open the file your_config_file.conf with any text editor and edit the fields URL, Username, Password and CoinbaseAddress (for solo mining only) inside the Connection block. Additional notes:            It is recommended to configure BatchTimeMs and OccupancyPct [options] (# Static and adaptive WorkSize configuration) for each Device in order to get the best performance or responsiveness of the desktop.           Use VerthashMiner -c your_config_file.conf to start mining.            Alternative (Windows). Create a file Run.bat in the same folder as VerthashMiner.exe with the following content:         VerthashMiner -c your_config_file.conf                       Additional notes:       To use NVIDIA GPUs with OpenCL backend when CUDA is available:         VerthashMiner -c your_config_file.conf --no-restrict-cuda                           Note that in this case your_config_file.conf must also be generated using the --no-restrict-cuda command.   Commands and options   There are many command line options available in Verthash Miner.   If you want to try command line options or need a specific option, you can add a short or long option in any order.) For example, use -h or --help   List of available commands:   Usage: VerthashMiner [options]  Options: =======  --algo &lt;algorithm&gt;                                 (-a)         Specify the algorithm to use:         - verthash (default)  --url  &lt;address&gt;                                   (-o)         Set URL of mining server in format (address:port).  --user &lt;user&gt;                                      (-u)         Set username for mining server.  --pass &lt;password&gt;                                  (-p)         Set password for mining server.  --cert &lt;File&gt;         Select certificate for mining server using SSL.  --proxy &lt;[PROTOCOL://]HOST[:PORT]&gt;                 (-x)         Connect through a proxy.  --cl-devices &lt;index,index,...&gt;  (-d)         Select specific OpenCL devices from the list, obtained by '-l' command.  --all-cl-devices         Use all available OpenCL devices from the list, obtained by '-l' command.

Fix problems   Verthash data file name is invalid   The miner does not see the file verthash.dat. You have to generate it and provide a path.   To generate, run the command:   VerthashMiner.exe --gen-verthash-data verthash.dat pause   And then specify the path to the place where the generated verthash.dat is located.   Example:   --verthash-data C:\\VerthashMiner\\verthash.dat   Miner configuration failed! (Errors: 1, Warnings: 0)   You have an error in your config file. Check it again for the presence of Sentax errors.   Conclusion   Thank you for reading to the end. Bookmark my site in your browser. Happy mining.
