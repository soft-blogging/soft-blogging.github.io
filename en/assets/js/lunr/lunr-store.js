(Low Power?) Tested with RTX 3060   GMiner and lolMiner have both released the latest versions of their respective miners, which boast a similar 65-69% unlock for ETH for the LHR cards when combared to NBMiner. However, they apparently now consume less power too! Ill test is out on Zotac Twin Edge OC RTX 3060 to see if that promise holds up!  a 70% ETH Hashrate Unlock for LHR (Limited Hash Rate) GPUs! Time to test it out on my LHR EVGA 3080 &amp; LHR Zotac 3060 Ti! Does it actually deliver on its 70% FHR promise?       subscribe          Lolminer - ETH unlock on RTX 3060 LHR v2, RTX 3070 LHR and RTX 3080 ti   Fantastic video. I'm mining ravencoin with my 8 3060ti on Hiveos. I want to get as many as possible before halving. I'm getting 27.5mhs with core 220, mem 800 and power 145w.        subscribe   Commands   To start mining with Lolmeiner, you need to specify three things, namely:      Mining algorithm.   Pool address or solo address to connect.   Username / wallet for mining.        Configure the algorithm for mining   LolMiner has two ways to specify the algorithm you want to mine. You need to choose one of them to start mining.   The first option is --algo (-a) followed by one of the following algorithm names:                  BEAM-I       BeamHash I                 BEAM-II       BeamHash II                 BEAM-III       BeamHash III                 C29D       CuckarooD 29                 C29Z       CuckarooZ 29                 C30CTX       Cuckaroo 30 Cortex                 C31       Cuckatoo 31                 C32       Cuckatoo 32                 EQUI144_5       Equihash 144/5                 EQUI192_7       Equihash 192/7                 EQUI210_9       Equihash 210/9                 ZEL       ZelHash           Note that you can always find out the supported algorithms with the command: lolMiner –list-algos. The size of the commission will also be shown. This list will inform you if the program supports the algorithm / requires the personalization parameter (--pers), which is needed for some Equihash-based algorithms.   The second way to configure lolMiner is through the --coin (-c)  parameter. This option sets more detailed settings for the selected profiles and allows you to use special features such as algorithm switches or a combination of an algorithm with the correct personalization.   You can check the detailed list of additional parameters for lolMiner using the lolMiner -h command.

Improvement of Ethash performance (up to 1%) and reduction of stale share rate for Maxwell and Pascal (GTX 10) based GPUs.   Changes LHR tuning algorithm to minimize the number of locks &amp; time for finding a stable value: The tuning might be improved by the miner later once stable for long enough time.   Improved LHR performance for 3060 V1 (GA106-300-A1) on older drivers (460.39 and earlier)   Added Ergo kernels for RX 6700XT and RX 6600 (XT) on newer AMD drivers.   Ethereum stratum code will now print the pool difficulty in better human readable number   The miner will now print the ip of the connected pool - to be able to detect e.g. faulty DNS entries   Added parameters --dualtls and --dualworker to toggle TLS and the worker name for the dual connection. To be used as with the parameters for the standard connection.   --statsformat can now distinguish between the number of LHR locks “lhrlks” and the current --lhrtune parameter lhrparam   Added a parameter --vstats to modify the terminal width in number of characters to overwrite the automatic detection, which sometimes does not work with some terminal emulators like putty.   Added a parameter --hstats. Given this parameter will switch the statistics to a way such that the statistics write a horizontal line per GPU instead of the default vertical (see screenshot below). When the automatic read terminal width is reached, the remaining entries will be printed to a 2nd set of lines. The vertical statistics can be combined with the usual --statsformat patterns to customize the displayed values per card. The optional number overwrites the the automatic screen width detection. To fit all values of --statsformat extended into one line we need --hstats 150 or higher (recommended setting this value manually when accessing the rig via terminal emulator). Fixes   Fixed 3060 V1 (GA106-300-A1) internal parameters for drivers 460.39 and below, stabilizing the hash rate (they pretty much did not work stably unlocked in 1.36)   Fixed a bug causing a wavy hash-rate report in some FHR rigs   Fixed a bug causing --mode a kernels to be defect for Ampere and Turing GPUs in 1.36(a) releases   Fixed a bug causing a segmentation fault when trying to mine EXCC.   1.36a   Feature updates     Improved Ethash &amp; Etchash performance on all Nvidia Turing &amp; Ampere GPUs by 0.3 to 0.7% depending on card &amp; system.   Decreased rate of stales on Nvidia Turing &amp; Ampere GPUs.   Modified LHR auto tuning to use finer steps (0.2 instead of 1). Also when the miner is more then 2 hours stable on its current settings and a lock appears, the card will unlock again, but the tuning will not be reduced.   New parameter: --lhrwait n will set the miner to wait n seconds, until the LHR detection and calibration gets active. Allows to wait for systems with delayed memory overclock settings.   Fixes     Fixed a potential crash between switching between cached Eth and Zil dag on Nvidia cards   Fixed a bug: Worker name got lost on ezil.me mining pool (since 1.34)   Fixed a bug causing rare defect shares on LHR cards   1.36a: Fixed a bug causing no LHR unlock to normal speed after epoch change   1.36a: Reverted some LHR kernels to a specification more similar to what was in 1.35. These are default in Windows and on RTX 3080 on Linux, other cards can request this kernels by using --lhrtune wauto or wTuneNumber in case the default is unstable.   1.35   Feature changes      Ergo: Adjusted all codes mining Autolykos v2 to be ready for the epoch 1 and higher, starting Sunday Nov 7th ~8 am UTC. To continue mining Ergo, please update to this version. (1)   Ergo: Added ability for all AMD cards to pre-build the next Ergo data set while mining. This is at a cost of slightly slower mining directly after a height change, but generally improves poolside performance. In case you find it unstable the pre-building can be deactivated by using parameter --ergo-prebuild -1 / 0 / 1. Here -1 stands for the cards default, 0 is off, 1 is on. Default is on for all AMD GPUs except GCN1 and Vega generations - those were more stable with the option turned off. The value can be set per card by using a comma separated list of values.   Ergo: Improved performance of AMD Hawaii generation of chips by about 2%.   Ethash: Added error correcting tables to check the DAG integrity up to epoch 499 (Early June 2022)   Ethash: Added option to use the version 1.33 semi-unlocker style - this was more performant for some GDDR6X cards. Use --lhrtune xauto to activate the 1.33 solver style auto tuning and use –lhrtune x to set a predetermined tune value. The 1.33 style solver can be mixed with 1.34+ style solvers by using a comma separated list of values.   Bug fixes     Ethash: Fixed a bug some crashed Nvidia cards did not trigger the watchdog   Ethash: Fixed a bug causing the worker name not to be correctly passed to the pool in some cases in 1.34(a)   (1) The new Ergo epochs will increase the size of the data set used for mining by 5% every ~75 days. Some cards might need a bit more core clock to achieve the used performance. Also 2G cards in zombie mode will see a significant reduction in speed, because the data set is more then 2150 MBytes in size now.   1.34a     Added further epochs to the dag correction detection / table. This can resolve issues with defect shares that appeared in 1.34 or earlier with start of epoch 450.   Slightly changes internal LHR parameters of 3070 ti &amp; 3080 - we hope to improve stability by this plus a small speedup.   1.34     Improved performance of RTX 3060 and RTX 3060 Ti by up to 2%, generally allowing a bit less core clock.   Auto tuning will now be quicker to reasonable hashrates.   Improved stability on found parameters.   Found parameters that are hard coded with --lhrtune are now applied within 30 seconds after dag build.   --lhrtune now understands the parameter “off” to disable any kind of LHR handling - this is useful for cards that sometimes trigger the lhr detection although they are non-LHR.   Improved compatibility with many current drivers. Still on Linux we recommend 470.74 for LHR v2 cards. The 460 series drivers might perform up to 0.5% worse. For 3060 LHR V1 use either 460.39 or earlier driver.   The parameter --workmulti now has effect on Nvidia GPUs on Ethash. Default value is 192, lower values will improve stale count, higher values will reduce CPU load (and can be a tiny bit quicker, although only very tiny).   Added support of RTX A6000 / RTX A5000 / RTX A4000 (and future RTX A2000) Nvidia workstation GPUs.   Reduced RAM usage of Nvidia Ethash solver (some 10+ card rigs got issues with 1.33 when they only had 4G of memory).   --statsformat now understands the string “lhrinfo” to print the --lhrtune parameter and the lock count in custom set up statistics.   Fixed a bug with --tstop or a lost stratum connection triggering a LHR GPU to lock.   Fixed a bug that RTX 3070Ti only triggered the lock detector on rather low memory clock.   Fixed a bug with invalid shares in Pitcairn Ergo Zombie mode.   Improved stability of Ethash stratum and statistics module.   1.33  Core Feature: Complete rework of LHR semi-unlock feature.      Better performance of LHR semi-unlock, about 70%+ on GDDR6x cards (3070 Ti &amp; 3080 (Ti) ), about 71-72%+ on GDDR6 (3060 (Ti) &amp; 3070), 81%+ on 3060 LHR V1 with the right drivers (earlier then 460.39). Recommended driver for LHR v2: 470.74 (Linux), 472.12 (Windows)   Important hint: We saw some calibration bugs with 460.93 driver (Linux). Please do not use it!     Less performance difference between low and high core clock then earlier versions   Cards are automatically detected if they are LHR - no more --mode switch required   In the beginning the miner will calibrate to your exact core &amp; memory clocks. The total process takes 3-4 minutes total, one with rather low speed and the remaining time with speed closer to the final value. Try not to change any overclock after or during calibration, else the performance might be lower then expected!   --lhrtune has now default value of auto for an automatic tuning. Results of automatic tuning will be displayed in stats after calibration is completed. Note: re-tuning of values used in 1.32a is required!   Other feature changes      Default --shortstats interval lowered to 15 seconds, default --longstats interval lowered to 60 seconds   More stable displayed hashrate on Nvidia cards when mining Eth   Changes in Api: On supported algorithms the miner now exposes the number of stale shares in API (stales and defect shares are no longer collapsed into one value)   Fixes:      Fixed a bug with processing old style --dualmode etc dualmine settings   Fixed some minor bugs of the API   Fixed a bug causing a non-realistic high hash rate to be displayed on LHR cards when overclocked after start  ","categories": ["miners"],

This is necessary to increase the performance of a gpu in mining and not only.   Variety of cards are supported: from and to RX580.   The main features of SRBPolaris are:     unlocking the backup shaders;   Copy memory straps fast and easy   copying / editing time periods of work,   Memory timing strap editor - make your own custom straps   Unlock RX460 additional shaders   Set GPU voltage   Set default GPU and MEM clocks   Lot’s of useful stuff   This program is considered convenient, easy to use, and, importantly, it is more suitable for beginners or those who are busy with other things, and who has no time to delve deeply into something and study.   Acceleration of the video card is achieved by changing the initial settings in the BIOS of the video card, which are used by the operating system and application programs that are read during the initialization of the equipment immediately after turning on the computer.   The firmware of video cards for mining gives a significant increase in performance, for example, the flashed RX 570 gives out 30-40% higher speed when mining, in contrast to the non-flashed version. Bypassing the firmware of video cards, you will most likely need to improve the drivers of the operating system.   After flashing, it is extremely simple and convenient to monitor and control the characteristics of the video card using the GPU-Z and HWinfo programs, the main task of which is to demonstrate the voltage, frequencies, load on the video card and many other information that will be extremely useful.   Overclocking can be easily checked in HWinfo by monitoring video memory errors. With a large number of these errors, it is necessary to reduce overclocking by decreasing the operating frequency of the video memory or flashing less aggressive timings.   SRBPolaris Won’t Start?   The program requires .NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0)   Install it:        You will see the Windows Installer:        You need to wait about 5-10 minutes.

In this guide, you will learn how to set up and use the latest version (0.24.7) of T-Rex to mine Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.   Download for Windows / Linux        Download from the website Download releases from GitHub Download releases from BitcoinTalk       Review     T-Rex Miner - is a multi-algorithm mining software optimized for NVIDIA graphics cards. This mining software can mine cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Ravencoin and others.     Miner T Rex is a command line program. This means that you run it either from the Windows command line, or from the Linux console, or create shortcuts to predefined command lines using a Linux Bash script or a Windows batch file.      How to Install T-Rex Miner  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the miner  \t\t \t\t \t\tFirst, you need to download the software from this link. Make sure you select the correct file for your OS. If you are on Windows, download the .zip file. If on Linux, select the .tar.gz file. From the names of the files, you can see that these are versions of the program for different versions of the CUDA driver for your video card.  \t\t   If in doubt, download everything. \t\t  \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Configure a batch file for Ethereum  \t\t \t\t \t\tOnce you download the program, you need to select the correct script file depending on the algorithm you want to use to mine cryptocurrency. Then edit the mining bat file and fill it with the wallet address, worker (farm) name and mining pool URL. Then save it as a .bat file if you are on Windows or bash - .sh if you are on Linux.  Here is an example T Rex Miner .bat file for the Binance Pool:  t-rex -a ethash -o stratum+tcp://ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 -u username1 -p x -w worker_name pause  \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Run T-Rex Miner  \t \t \t \t  Double click on the saved or finished start.bat file to start the miner.  \t  \t \t  \t \t \tVideo Guide  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Example T-Rex Miner for Binance Pool      STRATUM: ethproxy+tcp://ethash.poolbinance.com   PORT: 8888   Username: username1   Password: x     This is how the ready-made T-Rex Miner bat file for ETH on the Binance Pool will look like        Just replace username1 with the name of your Binace pool account.   Example:   t-rex -a ethash -o stratum+tcp://ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 -u username1 -p x -w worker_name pause   If you want to understand how to set up everything from scratch, then you need to enter 5 commands one by one:           t-rex - the name of the program we run   ethash - algorithm for mining   ethash.poolbinance.com - pool address   8888 - pool port   username1 - username from the mining account on the exchange.   To set up a batch file for another coin - Firo (MTP), we need to enter other commands:   @echo off :start t-rex -a mtp -o stratum+ssl://zcoin.mintpond.com:3005 -u aMLjCeLBmBGEJP6dYtWEMdZZuPH4w6uFsK.rig0 -p x goto start pause   Here we added @echo off - it is used so that the extra text of the command itself is not displayed on the screen.   Next comes the cycle    :start the command itself goto start  This construct organizes the looping of the command execution. But in this case the load on the processor increases slightly.

This leads to much lower power consumption, in my case almost a 20% reduction in wattage without reducing hashrate. Using absolute core clock in a crypto mining software like Trex miner is a new and better way of overclocking your graphics cards that leads to much lower electricity being used which means cheaper power bills!   &nbsp;       T-rex Miner LHR Unlock in HiveOS - Nvidia LHR GPU Partially Unlock Settings in HiveOS      To enable LHR mode, you need to explicitly tell the miner which GPUs are LHR and which are not. This is done by specifying --lhr-tune parameter which takes values from 0 to 8:  0 - disabled (use for non-LHR cards) 1 - lowest hashrate, low chance of LHR lock 4 - recommended starting value for most LHR cards 8 - highest hashrate, high chance of LHR lock   Hive OS parameter ex : \"lhr-tune\": \"4,0,4,8\"         &nbsp;       Phoenix Miner VS T Rex - Which ETHEREUM miner gives the best stats?

The reason is HiveOS sets hashrate-avr: 30 for T-Rex causing it to report 30-seconds average hashrate as opposed to 1-minute average (default).   A temporary solution would be to edit your flight sheet and manually add hashrate-avr: 60 to the Extra config arguments field.

To set up a batch file for solo mining, we need to run the wallet in server mode with port 9999 and enter other commands:   cpuminer-sse2.exe -a scrypt -o http://127.0.0.1:9999 --coinbase-addr DKs5E8nWJe2E5vYnVSoYqNjw2T17nGYUDo  pause   Here we added --coinbase-addr  - used for solo mining.   You can try adding the rpc resolving IP to create .conf file To allow connections only from your local network, you can specify your subnet in the rpcconnect parameter. You also need to specify the internal IP address of the machine you are connecting the miner to in rpcconnect. Then start the wallet in server mode and use the wallet IP, rpcuser, rpcpassword and rpcport in the miner config file.

If you have upgraded the Google Chrome browser to version 91, you may have noticed that some file downloads don’t work anymore in the browser.   But first, here’s a brief explanation of why this happens, assuming you know the file you’re trying to download is safe. Google Chrome and other web browsers will try and identify possibly malicious files. One minor flaw in this concept is that most web browsers often will flag unknown files as malicious. This is commonly known as heuristics, which is a fancy word for guessing.   But here comes a problem, files considered as unsafe by Chrome might however be “clean.” It can be frustrating when Chrome keeps blocking a download that you know it is from a trusted source.   See: How to Stop Chrome from Blocking Downloads        Changelog   5.9d      Added support for the latest AMD Linux drivers 21.40.1. There are some bugs in these drivers, particularly the clocks and voltages can’t be set properly with older cards (RX4x0/RX5x0/Vega/RadeonVII);   Validated support for the latest AMD Windows drivers up to 21.11.2;   Fixed issues with AMD RX6700XT cards with the latest AMD and Linux drivers;   Fixed issues with AMD Vega and Radeon VII cards on latest Windows and Linux drivers;   Fixed crash with very old Nvidia drivers (3xx.x);   Other fixes and small improvements   5.9c      Show the GPU vendor name in the list of GPUs to make it easier to identify the GPUs.   5.9b   The updated list of known issues (driver incompatibilities, etc.) and workarounds:      AMD Linux driver 21.40.1 has a bug preventing proper setting of clocks and voltages on older cards (RX4x0/RX5x0/Vega/RadeonVII). Given that these drivers are also usually slower than the older drivers for these cards, we recommend using Linux drivers 20.30 for anything older than RX6000 series.   If you are using Linux drivers 21.40.1 with Radeon VII cards, you need to add the option -fpwm 1 in order to have proper fan control.   AMD Linux drivers 21.40.1 has finally removed the requirement of PCIe atomics but there are problems when you try to mix Polaris (RX4x0/5x0) cards and Vega or newer cards on the same rig.   Some Nvidia cards will report a lot of stale shares under Windows 11. Using the same driver version under Windows 10 resolves the issue.   5.8c      Fixed a crash on Linux when mining on RDNA2 AMD cards (RX6x00) with older drivers   Removed error messages when mining on fanless Nvidia cards   5.8b      Implemented optimized kernels for AMD RX6600XT cards;   Added support for the latest AMD Windows drivers (21.10.2, 21.10.1, 21.9.2, and 21.9.1). Note that any AMD cards older than Polaris (RX470/480/570/580/590) won’t work with the latest AMD drivers;   Added support for the latest AMD Linux drivers 21.30;   The latest AMD drivers (21.9.1 and later for Windows, and 21.30 and later for Linux) dropped support for the older kernels, so we changed the kernels for AMD Polaris cards to support these new drivers. There is a very small speed improvement (less than 0.1% on average) with the new kernels and the new drivers on Polaris cards;   Other fixes and small improvements.   5.7b      Implemented new “turbo” kernels (-clkernel 3) for AMD Polaris cards that can work with the current DAG sizes over 4 GB. Note that -clkernel 3 uses double the VRAM and will provide slightly faster hashrate with slightly higher power consumption. You can use the -rvram command-line parameter to specify how much VRAM to be left unused;   Increased the maximum supported DAG epoch to 600 (i.e. until about Sep 2023);   Implemented full hardware control for AMD RX6900/6800/6700 cards under Linux. Note that with these cards under Linux you need to specify relative core voltage: e.g. -cclock -50 will set the core voltage to be 50 mV under the default value;   Added ROCr kernels for Vega, Radeon VII and Navi cards. With these kernels you will be able to run these cards with Linux drivers 20.45 and later but the performance will be lower than with the older PAL drivers and kernels. We recommend using AMD Linux driver 20.30 for all cards except RX6900/6800/6700;   Fixed an issue causing crashing with some RX6900/6800/6700 cards under Linux (there is no need to run these cards with -clkernel 0 anymore);   Added support for AMD Windows drivers up to 21.7.2. Note that Radeon VII cards will not work with drivers 21.6.1 or higher - you need to use older drivers for proper operation of these cards;   Added support for AMD Linux drivers up to 21.20 (use older drivers for Vega or Radeon VII cards as they will not work with 21.20)   Numerous other fixes and small improvements.   5.6d      Fixed problem with displaying GPU temperatures of some Nvidia GPUs.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to download and how to use MyCrypto v 2.5.35 and newer.   Download for Windows / Linux        Download releases   Official site       What is MyCrypto?     MyCrypto -  is a cryptocurrency wallet created by the founder of MyEtherWallet. It works with Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens . Can integrate Ledger Nano S, Trezor and other popular hardware wallets or desktop applications. Also, here you can exchange ERC-20 coins not only with ETH, but also with other cryptocurrencies.      Review     The creator of the MyCrypto wallet is Taylor Monahan, the founder of the popular cryptocurrency wallet MEW. At one time, he left the project, taking part of the team. In 2018, he released his own wallet, calling it a direct competitor to MyEtherWallet. In fact, it is a fork, and therefore the interface will be familiar to many. For the exchange of cryptocurrencies, a special service is involved here, implemented directly into the program. The application runs on a PC.           How to use  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download and Install  \t\t \t\tThe cryptocurrency wallet can be downloaded from the official website mycrypto.com. When choosing, make sure that this application is suitable for your operating system, be it Windows, Mac or Linux. Otherwise, the program may not work.  \t\t   \t\t \t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Install the wallet  \t\t \t\t \t\tAfter downloading the archive to your PC, run the installation file - MyCrypto.exe. Installation will not take long. In fact, it runs automatically. Upon completion, open the program to create a MyCrypto wallet. You will be shown a presentation.  \t\t    \t\tTo make it more convenient, go to the language menu (it is located at the bottom left) and select \"Change Language\". Here you will be offered the different languages ​​that the program supports.      \t\t \t\tChoose the one that is easier for you to work with. \t\t   \t\t    \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Create a wallet  \t ext, go to the \"Create New Wallet\" section. The corresponding settings appear. If you build it from scratch i.e. you have no hardware device or passphrase from your old wallet, then click \"Generate a Wallet\".     At this stage, the system will offer a choice:       Create a secret SEED phrase (\"Mnemonic Phrase\"). Use a key file (\"Keystore File\").    Since everything is simple with the secret phrase: write it down separately, keep it like the apple of your eye and enter it as needed; then we will describe in the article how to work with the keystore. It is a key store. To create it, you need to click on \"Generate a Keystore File\". After that, the system will ask you to enter a password.        It says here that you need to create the most difficult combination. In this case, there must be a different case (uppercase and lowercase letters), as well as a number. The harder you come up with a password, the better. However, we recommend that you write it down somewhere so as not to lose it. Then click on the \"Create New Wallet\" button.  Save your Keystore file    This stage is very important, and the system will inform you about it.   The file needs to be protected, as it stores the private key that gives access to your wallet. It is best to save it to third-party media in several ways so as not to lose it. To do this, connect the USB flash drive and click \"Upload file\". Select the path to your USB stick and save. Then click on \"Continue\" to finish setting up the program.  Save your private key    The system will offer to save the private key in the form of a paper wallet. To do this, she will print it in the form of a QR code.      If necessary, you can simply scan it in the future to gain access to your cryptocurrency wallet. MyCrypto users in their reviews talk about the convenience of such storage. This completes the procedure for creating a cryptocurrency wallet. You can enter it by clicking \"View and Send\". The section is located at the top left.  After that, the system will ask for the choice of gaining access to the cryptocurrency wallet in order to carry out the operation. To do this, you can use:      keystore file, private key or secret phrase.  The latter is also called a seed password or mnemonic phrase.    When choosing a file, the system will offer to load it from the media. To do this, connect the USB flash drive, open the file through the wallet and enter the password. Then click the \"unlock\" button.          The wallet will display all the wallet data. The top right shows:  address (public key used to transfer tokens to the account) Below is the balance of your account. In the middle, it is displayed in fiat currency.     \t \t  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tVideo Guide  \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     How to transfer and use tokens   Naturally, you can transfer digital coins to other cryptocurrency wallets. To do this, in the wallet, you need to select the item for sending Ether and tokens. It is located in the corresponding section. To carry out the operation, unblock the wallet using the method of your choice.   You will see a window where you need to specify:         Address - the private key to which you want to send coins.   The amount you want to transfer and the type of coin.   Set your transaction fees.   Check the entered data and click “Send Transaction”. If you wish, you can set the commission manually. To do this, click on the “Advanced” button. Then confirm the operation.   After completion, you will see a window about the successful completion of the procedure. The system will also provide a link where you can check the status of the operation and its confirmation. For this, the wallet uses the Etherscan service.   How to use ERC-20 coins   There are two ways to use tokens in MyCrypto:   If digital coins are already known to the program. Here you can click the “Scan For Tokens” button.        At the bottom right, the system will automatically detect them. At the end of the identification, add the ones you need from the list to your wallet. To do this, check the boxes next to the cryptocurrency of interest, and then click the “Save” button. When finished, they will be displayed in the wallet.   If you want to use a digital coin that the crypto wallet does not yet know, then you need to register it yourself. This procedure will be somewhat more complicated.   To register a new ERC-20 cryptocurrency, you need to go to the Etherscan portal. In the search box, enter the name of the digital coin you want to add. The site contains all known tokens and data on them. It will return the result with the address of the contract. Your task is to copy the decimal places, the coin symbol, as well as the address itself. Go back to the wallet and go to the same section. Then click “Add your token”.   A window will appear for you where you need to specify the address, decimal places and the symbol of a digital coin, click “Save”. If everything is done correctly, then the cryptocurrency will be added to your wallet.   What are the reviews?   The wallet has received positive reviews in terms of reliability, not only for ease of use, but also for additional functionality. One of the options is transaction tracking. To do this, you need to insert a hash of the operation to check the status and how many confirmations the transaction has received.   It also has a built-in exchange service. It can be used to quickly convert Ethereum to Bitcoin or ERC-20 digital coins. The wallet provides a section for developers. Here you can see how to create or add new smart contracts to the Ethereum blockchain network. You can transfer transactions that were created and signed automatically.   Is the wallet safe?   With wallets like Mycrypto, you keep your private key in full, so you are responsible for keeping it safe. In case you lose it, the project team will not have a backup in their database. Thus, special care must be taken to prevent attackers from obtaining a copy of the private key.   For security:      Make sure you are not visiting phishing sites. Try installing the MetaMask or EAL browser extensions, which will warn you whenever you accidentally visit a crypto phishing webpage.   Do not use a wallet to store large funds. For such storage, use any of the hardware devices recommended by Mycrypto: Ledger, Trezor, or Keepkey.   Avoid visiting random URLs.   The app is very similar to MyEtherwallet and is considered MEW’s biggest competitor. If you are going to use an Ethereum wallet on your desktop, Mycrypto is much safer than MEW as it does not require you to use the wallet in your web browser, which is much more risky.   Overall, MyCrypto is very user-friendly. Even a beginner will be able to cope with the wallet, since the functionality and interface are intuitive. Developers actively keep in touch with users.          MyEtherWallet / MyCrypto Split &amp; Drama      subscribe   ","categories": ["wallets"],

Features  Exodus is a cryptocurrency wallet with many positive qualities. We will highlight the main ones:      No registration. It is enough to download the software installation file from the official portal and carry out the installation.   No verification. You do not need to verify your identity to use the program.   Doesn’t require a lot of hard disk space. It is a “lightweight” program that works with a remote server to load the blockchain network.   Round-the-clock support of the program by developers. Multi-currency software. More than a hundred cryptocurrencies to work with.   Intuitively simple interface. The program is easy to work with.   Dynamic commission. Placed automatically for entering a transaction into the nearest block. At the same time, by default, the wallet does not take a commission for itself.   The ability to recover through the use of a secret phrase.   Strong encryption of private keys and personal data. The storage takes place locally on the PC. There is no third-party access to them.   Negative reviews  There are also negative reviews on the crypto wallet.      For example, people are unhappy with closed source code. After all, you cannot be 100% sure how the program works.   The automatic installation of the commission also does not make everyone happy. You cannot change it manually in any way.   To receive a SEED phrase, which, if necessary, will restore the wallet, you need to replenish your account. Otherwise, the program will not issue a seed.   However, even with these disadvantages, the application is still popular. In addition to the above, the program has no other disadvantages.   Conclusions   Cryptocurrency wallets are now dark. However, only a few of them are capable of supporting multicurrency. This wallet is one of those.  ","categories": ["wallets"],

        "excerpt":"               CGMiner: Setting up for maximum profit, Commission, Comparison with t-rex          This guide describes how to start and how to use the CGMiner version 3.7.2 and higher.   Download for Windows / Linux        Download from site   Download releases   Download from BitcoinTalk       What is CGMiner?     CGMiner - is an open source miner for ASIC, GPU and FPGA. It works on Windows, Linux and macOS. CGMiner is extremely flexible in terms of platform and can work with a variety of hardware miners and GPUs including AMD, CUDA and NVIDIA platforms.     Supported algorithms     The program supports the following algorithms:          Scrypt     SHA-256     NeoScrypt     CryptoNight       While developing the program, programmers focused on the performance of their software. Therefore, it is not the most convenient to use. In fact, the console is used for management with the introduction of certain commands, but there is no graphical shell. As a result, it can be difficult for beginners to operate this software.          How to use CGMiner  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the program  \t\t There are two options to download the program:  Official website of the developer..  On the GitHub site.     On the official website you will find a complete instruction with a description of all the commands of the program. The address of the official page on GitHub  is here. This way you can be sure that the program is safe and free of malware. Do not use third-party sources - you can lose access to data and your tokens.       \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tШаг 2 - Set up the program  \t\t \t\t Settings are entered through the console. We recommend using a batch file (a text file with an extension .bat) for more convenience. In it, you can save all the necessary data so that you do not enter them when you restart the program again. Using the coinfoundry example, the batch file will look like this:  setx GPU_FORCE_64BIT_PTR 0 setx GPU_MAX_HEAP_SIZE 100 setx GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS 1 setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100 setx GPU_SINGLE_ALLOC_PERCENT 100 cgminer --scrypt -I 10 -o stratum+tcp://pool.coinfoundry.org:3151 -u DKs5E8nWJe2E5vYnVSoYqNjw2T17nGYUDo.my_worker_password -p my_worker_password -T  pause  Enter instead DKs5E8nWJe2E5vYnVSoYqNjw2T17nGYUDo your Dogecoin wallet address.   \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Start the miner  \t The miner is launched by double-clicking on the file with the extension .bat.   You will see the following window:       The bottom line displays the hash rate.    \t \t  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tVideo Guide  \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Configuration file   Here is a listing of the contents of the file cgminer.conf. It is also better to fill it in:   { \"pools\" : [ \t{ \t\t\"url\" : \"stratum+tcp://dogeminingpool.com:3009\", \t\t\"user\" : \"DKs5E8nWJe2E5vYnVSoYqNjw2T17nGYUDo.1\", \t\t\"pass\" : \"password\" \t} ] , \"intensity\" : \"13\", \"vectors\" : \"1\", \"worksize\" : \"256\", \"kernel\" : \"scrypt\", \"lookup-gap\" : \"2\", \"thread-concurrency\" : \"8192\", \"shaders\" : \"2048,\", \"gpu-engine\" : \"0-0\", \"gpu-fan\" : \"0\", \"gpu-memclock\" : \"0\", \"gpu-memdiff\" : \"0\", \"gpu-powertune\" : \"0\", \"gpu-vddc\" : \"0.000\", \"temp-cutoff\" : \"75\", \"temp-overheat\" : \"85\", \"temp-target\" : \"65\", \"api-port\" : \"4028\", \"expiry\" : \"120\", \"gpu-dyninterval\" : \"7\", \"gpu-platform\" : \"0\", \"gpu-threads\" : \"2\", \"hotplug\" : \"5\", \"log\" : \"5\", \"no-pool-disable\" : true, \"queue\" : \"1\", \"scan-time\" : \"60\", \"scrypt\" : true, \"temp-hysteresis\" : \"3\", \"shares\" : \"0\", \"kernel-path\" : \"/usr/local/bin\" }    Setting up a bat file   Setting up is relatively easy once you know all the basic commands.   The main .bat file setting has the following data:   Cgminer –scrypt –o stratum+tcp\\\\:pool_address:port –u wallet.1 – p x   Here:      Cgminer –shows the file used to run the miner.   -scrypt – an indication of the algorithm used to obtain the digital token that the miner should use.   -o – after it you need to specify the address of the pool with the port. Take them in the pool where you are going to mine. You can find it in the “Getting Started” category.   -u user – displaying the login that was used when registering on the pool, here enter the name of the worker, which was made there.   -p x – enter the password that was used to create the worker.   This completes the configuration of the bat file.   Example for dogecoin   setx GPU_FORCE_64BIT_PTR 0 setx GPU_MAX_HEAP_SIZE 100 setx GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS 1 setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100 setx GPU_SINGLE_ALLOC_PERCENT 100 cgminer --scrypt -I 10 -o stratum+tcp://stratum.aikapool.com:7915 -u my_worker_name.my_worker_password -p my_worker_password -T  pause   Commands   To get a fine configuration, you need to use a number of special commands:   -auto-fan – adjusting the speed of the GPU cooler to maintain a certain temperature. Sets the metric automatically.   -auto–gpu – sets the GPU frequency to maintain a certain temperature. Works automatically.   -device (-d) – defines a specific video card. By default, the program launches everything it detects. The value of the card is placed next to it (for example, -device 1).   Disable GPU   -disable-gpu (-G) - disabling graphics processors.        -gpu-threads (-g) - setting the amount of threads on the graphics processor. The indicator is set from 1 to 10. By default, the program sets 2. The value is placed next to the command - -gpu-thread.   -gpu-dyinterval - setting the refresh period in milliseconds for video adapters using dynamic intensity. Standard cost -gpu-dyinterval.   -gpu-engine-  setting the frequency indicator for the video adapter. It is permissible to enter both one indicator and a whole range. It looks like this: -gpu-engine 700 or 700-900.   -gpu-fan - setting the fan speed in percentage, a certain value or range. It looks like this: -gpu-fan 50 or 50-65.   -gpu-map - matches OpenCl with ADL hardware number manually or paired CSV. For example, 1: 0.2: 1 shows OpenCl 1 over ADL 0.2 over 1.   -gpu-memlock - setting the memory frequency. In the case of bitcoin mining, we recommend lowering it, for litecoin - raising it. Looks like that: -gpu-memlock   -gpu-memdiff - sets the specific difference between kernel and memory. The indicator is entered in megahertz. It looks like this: -gpu-memdiff ???.   -gpu-powertune - GPU powertune installation. The value is selected in%.   -gpu-reorder - re-sorting video cards.   -Gpu-vddc - change the voltage on the core. The data is entered in this form: -gpu-vddc125.   -intensity (–I) - sets the intensity. The range of selectable indicators is from one to 14. Setting the value “d” - indicates that the indicator is dynamic. It looks like this: -intensity 10 or d.   -kernel (-k) - specifying the kernel for the hardware. It can be diablo, poclbm, phatk, diakgcn. It looks like this: -kernel diakgcn - help is needed in choosing kernels for GPUs.   -ndevs (-n`) - displays a list of graphics processors, number and outputs.   -temp-hysteresis - the temperature difference in ℃ from the expected indicator is indicated. The standard cost is 3. It looks like this:-temp-hysteresis   -temp-overheat - temperature, specified in ℃, when dropping core frequencies. This is where the coolers work faster (rpm increase). Fitted as standard 85. It looks for example like this: -temp-overheat 95.   -temp-target - the desired temperature is set. The value is in degrees. Standard costs 75. It looks like this: -temp-target 90.   -vectors (-v) - sets the width of vectors. By default, the indicator is selected automatically, but you can specify your own: 1, 2 or 4. Here it is indicated as follows: -vectors   -worksize(-w) - the size of the memory is set. However, it has virtually no effect on performance. Automatic selection of the indicator is standard. When self-introduction, select it in multiples of 64: 64, 128, etc. Recommended 256. Looks like this: -worksize   How to set up in windows 10?    setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100 setx GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS 2 cgminr.exe –srypt –worsize 512 –intensity 10 –auto-fan –lookup-gap 4 –thread-concurrency 25614 – gpu-engine 1050 –gpu-memlock 1500 –gpu-powertune 15 –o stratum+tcp: east1.us.stratum.dedicatedpool.com:3352 u worker -p XXX   where XXX is the worker password.   Please note that the miner is also compatible with Linux and OSX. In the case of Linux, you can also enable remote access. However, it will not be possible to configure the operation of the video adapter as efficiently as on Windows.          How to Setup CGMiner to Mine Cryptocurrencys (Litecoin &amp; Dogecoin)      subscribe   Review   The program is aimed exclusively at experienced users who are mining cryptocurrencies. Consequently, the functionality is versatile. The software was launched back in 2011. Since then, it has only improved and increased its positive qualities. The launch was made with open source code, which allows you to be confident in the reliability of the software.   The main developer was Kon Kolivas. He is also known for contributing to the development of Linux. At the same time, he is an anesthesiologist by profession, developing programs for him is a simple hobby.   The program is recognized as the most effective software for the extraction of electronic tokens using AMD and NVidia video adapters.   The software allows you to improve the performance of video adapters, making it possible to fine-tune graphics devices.        Most of the known digital coins can be mined on these algorithms. It is used in the mining of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Monero, Litecoin and other well-known digital tokens. Provides a number of benefits:      Allows you to overclock GPUs, providing excellent functionality.   You can adjust the rotational speed of the coolers used in cooling systems.   The algorithms used provide the most efficient cryptocurrency mining.   You can enable automatic switching between workers.   Work with the use of proxy servers is available.   There is no commission for using the program. Hence, it is 100% free.   There is a balancing of the algorithm.   If the workers are not working, the program will disable them.   Key features   The official site allows you to download the software for free. However, please note that the latest versions of the program focused exclusively on ASICs and FPGAs, since the developers decided not to continue to support mining on CPUs and video processors. It is worth using old software releases for them. These include versions prior to 3.7.8.   Basically, it is worth working on AMD, since the software does not work well with CUDA. For NVidia, it is better to choose another miner, for example, Claymore.   The program has several interesting points. One of them is the introduction of tools to overclock GPUs and set the desired fan speed in the cooling system. True, it is worth using this functionality carefully, since there is a high chance of spoiling the equipment and sending it to the scrap.   The program also provides configuration information, automatically turns off the worker, causing problems or simply not working. You can use proxy, balance loading strategy and Round Robin. Thanks to this, miners can independently enter the parameters of the width of the vectors, the waiting time for the connection restoration, create a specified delay for the router and configure a separate display of notifications. The work of the program is configured through a special configuration file.   Conclusions   There are a huge number of cryptocurrency programs that help set up equipment for mining digital tokens. They are called miners - this is special software that allows you to make the equipment work as efficiently as possible. However, not all of them are successful, some have poor functionality, others have a complex interface. Cgminer is one of the few programs that has proven its effectiveness empirically. It is used by a huge number of miners around the world.   ","categories": ["miners"],

It significantly increases the hash rate when mining cryptocurrencies using the Ethash algorithm (Dagger Hashimoto). The program is available for both Linux and Windows.     ETHlargementPill was released for GDDR5X memory only. All you need to do to increase the hashrate of Ethereum (ETH) or another Ethash based cryptocurrency to 50 MH/S on a GTX 1080 Ti (up to 40 MH/s on a GTX 1080) is to run it along with your miner.      Relevance and alternatives   NiceHash QuickMiner already includes the same functionality and is 100% safe to use. Use QuickMiner instead.   In 2021, OhGodAnETHlargementPill is no longer needed if you are using PhoenixMiner. You should use the command -straps 2 for the same effect.   In another mining program - NBMiner, use the command -mt. It does the same thing as a pill. This setting is enabled when mining on 1080 and 1080ti GPUs.

Run --revA Command with the Tool.   Some GTX 1080s don’t run well with the default tool, so they could attempt to use this command. This is also found on the ethlargement’s prescription:   Windows: OhGodAnETHlargementPill.exe --revA 0,3,4   Powershell: .\\OhGodAnETHlargementPill.exe --revA 0,3,4   Linux: ./OhGodAnETHlargementPill --revA 0,3,4   You may have noticed the numbers after --revA. These values are the gpu slots, and they are a requirement to run the program properly. For instance, if your mining rig is composed solely of GTX 1080s and you have 3 cards, it would be --revA 0,1,2.   Also, if you’re wondering how to do this for Windows, you have to use the command line and change directories or folders into the exact location of the ethlargement program before copy and pasting that command in. To know it works, it should pop up the program.   Note! Some GPUs will perform better if you run Ethlargement after your mining program start hashing away.   What GPUs does the tablet work for?   As mentioned above, the tablet only works with GDDR5X memory.

Download for Windows/Linux        Download from TechPowerUp   Download from guru3d       What is NVFlash?     NVFlash - is a program for flashing the BIOS of Nvidia video cards. It is used to update the firmware stored in the EEPROM of the video adapter. The application also allows you to save copies of the current BIOS to a file or display its version.     NVFlash supports flashing BIOS on the following NVIDIA graphics cards:          GeForce RTX 3090, RTX 3080, RTX 3070, RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 3060     GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, RTX 2080, RTX 2070, RTX 2060, GTX 1660, GTX 1650     GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, GTX 1080, GTX 1070, GTX 1060, GTX 1050     and many more, including flashing BIOS on older NVIDIA devices.       Warning!  There is a real danger that the display adapter will not boot and cannot boot the system if the update process is interrupted due to a program crash, power failure, if you manually restart the computer, or if you update the adapter with the wrong firmware image. For this reason, care should be taken when using this utility.

Video: Flashing a GTX 765M for Mac using nvflash      subscribe   Error pci subsystem id mismatch   The PCI subsys identifier is the card model. Please use the DOS version to resolve the error.   Also make sure that you have unlocked the BIOS:   nvflash64 -protectoff   Use the key -6:   nvflash64 -6 vbiosname.rom   The command -6 will allow you to undo the PCI Subsystem ID mismatch. In case of inconsistency, you need to confirm the action using the “y” key.   Note. Users with non-US keyboards may need to press “z” or similar, because “y” is not in the same place for all keyboard layouts.   SLI users will need to flash each card separately. The concept remains the same, but you will need to use the appropriate adapter index to flash the card. How to determine the adapter #. described above.   The flashing is done like this:    nvflash64 -i [index] -6 vbios.rom   [index] is a number, namely the index that you found with the command nvflash64 -a.   So, an example of a command for flashing a card with index 0:   nvflash64 -i0 -6 vbios.rom'   When the monitor starts flashing, just wait until a message appears that you are done.

Alternatives      ATI Winflash   Программа Flashrom   Radeon BIOS Editor (Due to the digital signature requirement on the latest AMD cards, RBE is no longer in active development and will not support the latest graphics cards.   Overview of program features   The utility is freely available free of charge. Supported on Windows XP and higher, up to the latest, tenth.   The utility has two modes of operation: through the command line (CMD) and the graphical shell (GUI). You can use any of the methods to update the BIOS. Before carrying out the procedure, be sure to download the BIOS of the required version for your device.   Do not turn off your computer while updating. Otherwise, a failure in the system will lead to the failure of the GPU. Also Atiflash DOS can keep the current firmware. If you run into problems with the new version of the software, it will help you roll back to the previous version.   The BIOS firmware should be changed for several reasons:      To increase the performance of the video card.   Change voltage parameters with power consumption.   To set up a system for mining cryptocurrency.   The software copes with each of the tasks.   The subtleties of the firmware through the graphical shell   Note that this method is only suitable if there are three GPUs in the system. Not more. Otherwise, the utility is not able to show all subsequent ones. Therefore, in this situation, it is worth using the command line. More about this above.   The video card must not only be displayed in Device Manager, but also fully functional. Otherwise, the AMD driver has blocked the custom BIOS.   If you have several identical AMD video cards in your system , then you need to specify the flashing of all video adapters with the same BIOS. Use the file where the modified BIOS is located (for example, BOIS_mod.rom). The command will look like this:   atiflash.exe-pa BIOS_mod_480.rom.   If you have two different GPUs in your system: R9390 and RX 5700, then run the utility with the key –i. View a list of all displayed graphics adapters. Remember the number of the required video adapter. In the command line, write:   Atiflash.exe -video adapter number   Suppose it has parameter 1. Then the command looks like this:   atiflash.exe –p 1 BOIS-mod_480.rom   Troubleshooting   Error 0fl01.        Freezing of the GPU or system when flashing BIOS. When updating the BIOS of the video adapter, you must disable it using the “Device Manager”. Also try restarting your computer.   After completing the BIOS update and restarting the PC, the graphics processor is detected, but does not work. There are manufacturer’s drivers that block the operation of the video adapter with an unsigned BIOS.

It’s on the right side of the utility (mV).        The essence of the selection of indicators is quite simple. Take the voltage from the lower category, for example 900 mV.   For example, you can get stability in the operation of the GPU with a frequency of 1153 MHz, when the voltage is 906 mV. In reality, the GPU operates with 2 voltage categories less. However, stability cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, each time it is necessary to carry out individual testing.   In other words, it is necessary to take the voltage from the lower stage, and the frequency from the upper one minus one.        The required indicators are entered into the utility and saved. During the initial creation, the system will recommend creating a file with a profile. In all the following settings for each video card or new profile, you will have to create a separate data file yourself. To do this, use the icon New.   By launching the utility and clicking on the menu that opens, the data of all video cards in the system are shown. Even those that are not supported by the utility are shown. If you select it, the program will warn you as a message This GPU is not supported, that is, this GPU is not supported. To work with such cards, you need MSI Afterburner along with a special BIOS firmware for the video adapter.    \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tTutorial Mining Ethereum from Zero: PhoenixMiner, ModBios, Overdriventool: \t \t \t \t subscribe \t    Fan control settings   In the settings, the required cooler speed indicators are additionally set. For the minimum, it is optimal to set 50-60% of the maximum allowable value.        The desired and maximum allowable temperature is also indicated. Electricity consumption is limited.   Zero RPM metric provides quiet operation with low GPU load and is enabled by default. The fans should spin up when the GPU is under load and the temperature rises. Zero RPMs are automatically disabled if any changes are made to Radeon ™ WattMan.   How to find power target values   Leave it zero % to draw normal TDP values. Set negative % to lower power draw. most people use -10 to -30 with stock BIOS. Max temp is when it will start to throttle speeds.   Power target actually an offset percentage so theoretically if you were to input 70 you would actually be telling the program you want a max power draw of ~240 Watts.   Profiles   By clicking the save button, the system automatically creates a file with the extension .ini, which indicates the entered overclocking values ​​and the rest of the graphics processor settings. To view all profiles, you need to expand the list of the corresponding name. To edit the settings, just run it .ini through a text editor or Word.   Downloading and checking the functioning of the selected profile will not take much time. Select it and click Load.        You can study the factory settings only after pressing the Reset button.      The file that allows you to run the utility automatically has the extension .bat. It is not there by default. You need to create it yourself.   A file with profiles, where overclocking settings, voltage drop, cooler speed and temperature indicators are recorded ( overdriventool.ini appears automatically when at least some profile is saved).        Startup   For the program to start automatically, a .bat file is created with the following content:   @echo Overdrive downvolt setting up  @echo off  timeout 15  OverdriveNTool.exe -p0\"0\" -p1\"1\" -p2\"2\" -p4\"4\" -p5\"5\"      -p from zero to 5 are the numbers of the GPUs;   the values ​​in quotation marks \"\" 0 through 5 are the names of the profiles applied to these video cards.

Video: OverDriveNTool autoload     subscribe   How to reset   To restore the work of the graphics processor when there were failures, in the old version of the utility it was required to add a command to the batch file –r. This made it possible to reset the settings of the video card to those set by the manufacturer. It looks like this:   -r5   Here 5 means the number of the video adapter.   After the release of 0.2.7, the restart is performed in automatic mode until the required parameters are set. The .bat file for autorun in the old version looks like this:   @echo Overdrive downvolt setting up  @echo off  timeout 15  OverdriveNTool.exe -r0 -r1 -r2 -r3 -r4 -r5  timeout 15  OverdriveNTool.exe -p0\"0\" -p1\"1\" -p2\"2\" -p4\"4\" -p5\"5\"   The timeout indicator is set individually. It depends on how quickly the system boots. For a hard disk, the time is about 30-50 seconds, while for an SSD, 5-20 seconds are enough. If the timeout time is too short, then the batch file settings will not be applied. Then an error. Therefore, do not rush to save a second for the optimal regime.

I created a script for my mining farm, in which, after restarting Windows, OverdriveNTool will disable / enable my cards before launching the software for miners (since they are known to sometimes reset after a crash, and this leads, for example, to too much power consumption)…   However, some cards did not give up and reset the voltage to some random number after pressing the “Apply” button. I found out that the new driver is to blame. So, I found a combination that works for me:      Version - OverdriveNTool 0.2.9.0   Driver - win10-radeon-software-adrenalin-2020-edition-20.4.2-apr23   When I installed the older 20.4.2 driver and also disabled Windows Updates, “AMD Crash Defender Service” and “AMD External Events Utility” via services.msc, I can finally use my .bat script to automatically overclock and start the miner without any problems after Windows crash.   I just noticed that I can no longer run the Adrenaline driver as it says my drivers and AMD software are not the same. Maybe it’s because my AMD reinstall was not completely clean as I didn’t delete the old AMD directory, but who cares, I don’t need it anymore.   Alternatives   Is there a version for Nvidia? No, there are alternatives. For example:      Nvidia Inspector   MSI Afterburner   ATI Winflash   Polaris Bios Editor          Beginners guide: Rx Vega 64 Ethereum mining Part 1:     subscribe   Use without a profile   It is easy to use the program without a profile file. To do this, you need to specify in the batch file all the values ​​for the subsequent overclocking of the graphics processor. For this, the following line fits:   -ac[gpu_id] GPU_P[num]=[value];[value][;0] Mem_P[num]=[value];[value][;0] Fan_Min=[value] Fan_Max=[value] Fan_Target=[value] Fan_Acoustic=[value] Power_Temp=[value] Power_Target=[value]   -ас installed with the key –р. All the indicators that were written further are applied, without applying the profiles from the .ini file.   If the indicators are value not registered, then the system will automatically ignore them.   In this situation, you need to specify the required indicator number pstate(num). In this case, the first is value indicated as the core frequency. The second value displays voltage. Note that the unit of measurement here is millivolts.   On a line, [;0] indicates the indicator is disabled Pstate.   If you specify the * frequency or voltage of video memory or core, the utility will ignore this indicator.   The timing level parameter optimizes memory latency settings to unlock some additional performance on certain (non-gaming) workloads.   In Linux, you can change the P-state values ​​for the kernel and VRAM in the same way as overclocking in Windows using OverdriveNTool. To manually change the overclocking parameters, you must first run the command:   sudo echo \"manual\"&gt; / sys / class / drm / card0 / device / power_dpm_force_performance_level   Command line parameters   [gpu_id] - it’s the first number taken from GPU description, for single video card it’s 0 \"Name\" - name of the profile that was saved ealier, must be quoted if has spaces inside   example:  OverdriveNTool.exe -p0myProfile -p1\"Profile 2\"      -p[gpu_id]\"Name\" - apply profile \"Name\" to GPU with id=[gpu_id]   -c[gpu_id]\"Name\" - same as above, but with confirmation message that application started and everything went ok.   -r[gpu_id] - reset GPU with id=[gpu_id]   cp[gpu_id]\"Name\" - compare current values of GPU with id=[gpu_id] with profile \"Name\", and eventually set this profile if not equal   cm[gpu_id]\"Name\" - compare current values of GPU with id=[gpu_id] with profile \"Name\", and eventually set this profile if not equal, with additional message if not equal found   co[gpu_id]\"Name\" - only compare current values of GPU with id=[gpu_id] with profile \"Name\", with message if not equal found   -consoleonly  - displays all messages (eg. errors) in cmd.exe console window, instead of gui messages. Only commands that are put after -consoleonly are affected, example:     \"OverdriveNTool.exe\" -consoleonly -r0 -p0\"1\" -r1 -p1\"1\" -r2 -p2\"2\" - will affect all commands \"OverdriveNTool.exe\" -r0 -p0\"1\" -r1 -consoleonly -p1\"1\" -r2 -p2\"2\" - will affect -p1\"1\" -r2 -p2\"2\" commands only           -showgui - when added to commandline normal GUI will be displayed after program finishes with all other commands.   -wait[miliseconds] - program waits specified time before parsing next command, useful if you want to add some delay for example on windows startup, can be used multiple times in one commandline.    example:   OverdriveNTool.exe -wait3000 -r0 -wait500 -p0profile1   In this example application starts without gui, then sets \"myProfile\" to GPU with id=0 and \"Profile 2\" to GPU with id=1 and then exit.   commands can be used all together, for example:   OverdriveNTool.exe -p0myProfile -r0 co1\"Profile 1\"   On configs with more than 10 GPUs [gpu_id] must have 2 digits, for GPUs 0-9 leading 0 must be added, example:   00,01,02,03,04,05,06,07,08,09,10,11,12. Usage example: -p05\"Name\"   It’s possible to use * as [gpu_id], which means it affects all supported GPUs, example:   -r* -p*MyProfile -p2\"Custom profile\" cm*MyProfile   Advanced:   -ac[gpu_id] GPU_P[num]=[value];[value][;0] Mem_P[num]=[value];[value][;0] Fan_Min=[value] Fan_Max=[value] Fan_Target=[value] Fan_Acoustic=[value] Power_Temp=[value] Power_Target=[value]   -ac is similar to -p command, applies values but without using profiles. Format is identical to ini profile. All not specified values will remain untouched. Can be used with other commands (-consoleonly, * as [gpu_id], -r, -p… etc.)   [num] - Pstate number, using # as [num] will apply to highest available Pstate for scpecified GPU [value] – value, for GPU and memory PState first value is clock (MHz), second is voltage (mV), third optional ;0 makes this Pstate disabled.   Putting * as Memory or GPU value will skip applying this value, for example: -ac0 GPU_P7=*;800 Mem_P3=1000;* (only applies GPU_P7 voltage=800mV and Memory P3 clock=1000MHZ) -ac0 GPU_P4=*;*;0 (only disables GPU_P4 without changing it’s values)   For I2C settings use –ac with Offset=[value] LLC=[value] PhaseGain=[value] CurrentScale=[value]   I2C must be enabled and supported for specified GPU, otherwise it will not work. Offset value is multiplied by 6,25mV, so 10 = +62,5mV, -5 = -31,25mV   Example:  -ac0 Offset=10 LLC=0 -ac0 Offset=-5 LLC=1 PhaseGain=000000 CurrentScale=60   Commands example:   -ac0 GPU_P7=1200;800 Mem_P2=1000;850 Fan_Min=1080 Fan_Max=1700 Fan_Target=70 Fan_Acoustic=700 Power_Temp=90 Power_Target=50 -ac1 GPU_P#=1200;800 Mem_P#=1000;850   -ac0 GPU_P7=1200;800;0 Mem_P3=1000;850 Fan_Min=1080 Fan_Max=1700   -consoleonly -r5 -ac5 GPU_P#=1200;800 Mem_P#=1000;850 Fan_Min=1080 Fan_Max=1700 -ac4 Fan_Target=70 Fan_Acoustic=700 Power_Temp=90 Power_Target=50   -ac* Power_Target=-1 GPU_P7=*;*;0   -wait1000 -r0 -ac0 GPU_P7=1200;800 Mem_P1=700;850;0 Mem_P2=750;850;0 Mem_P3=800;850;0 Mem_P4=1000;850 Fan_Min=1080 Fan_Max=1700 Fan_Target=70 Fan_Acoustic=700 Power_Temp=90 Power_Target=50  ```batch -ac0 Power_Target=50 -ac1 Power_Target=-50 -ac2 Fan_Max=1700 Fan_Min=1080 -ac1 Fan_Acoustic=700   -getcurrent - prints current values for all supported GPUs in cmd console window.   -t[gpu_id]   restart GPU with id=[gpu_id]. It’s similar to devices manager enable/disable GPU. Useful for immediately apply registry changes done to AMD keys like SoftPowerPlay table. It requires admin rigths to work.   Troubleshooting   Driver is detected as not installed / loaded - The program has detected an incompatible driver. Make sure you have selected the AMD graphics card in the upper field of the program.   If the program says: “gpu not supported” - try to remove the drivers completely through the display deiver unistaller and stop them.      Work around the bug in the driver 17.7.2. which appears when using the default voltage instead of the programmed ones. If it occurs, reset everything and reapply the profile.   Can be off / on. any state P. Here you need to click on P0, P1, etc. If this state is disabled, then the video card will not use it.   I2C can currently support IR3567B. This includes the RX470-480 series, as well as individual RX5xx. Also there is support for up   If you don’t want to change the cooler settings. Then disable this section in all video cards. This can be done as follows: press CLTR + double-click in the cooler window. It will be saved according to the video card ID. Due to this, the graphical interface or commands will not be able to affect the configuration of the cooler for the installed video card.   To open the settings or the SoftPowerPlayTable editor, double-click the program icon. It is located at the top left. You can also right-click on a title.   To change the “friendly name”, you need to enable it in the settings. Then press RMB on the list of video cards to open the menu.   Old versions   0.2.9 (14.06.2020)     fixed: Application recognizes driver not installed in 20.5.1 (or newer)   added profiles with reordering   0.2.8 (04.16.2019)  support for fan curve and memory sync level introduced in driver 18.12.2 (removed min, max fan, target fan temp and power temp) * added command -wait     added the ability to apply or reset all supported GPUs at once using Ctrl + Apply or Ctrl + Reset fixed a bug with duplicating graphics processors and profiles when using the command -showgui   Conclusions   This utility is hosted on the official resource at SourceForge, not on GitHub. There is also a discussion thread at techpowerup.   Despite the fact that the program is released only in English, it will be understood by anyone who has worked with utilities designed to overclock GPUs before.   For effective mining, you need to use the capabilities of the video card at full capacity. It is quite simple to work with the program.  ","categories": ["tools"],

        "excerpt":"               AMD Watt Tool: Download from the official site, change timings using the example of RX 580 and Vega.          In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up and use WattTool v0.92 and newer.   Download for Windows / Linux        Download from Overclock.net       What is WattTool?     WattTool - used to reduce power consumption and overlocking video cards from AMD. The program is suitable exclusively for miners. It is able to change the voltage and frequency control of the video adapters. The utility is especially popular for the RX line, both 480 and 580.     Supported video cards:          RX 470, RX 480, RX 560, RX 570, RX 580       Attention!  While you can use WattTool, it is no longer supported. It was replaced by the OverdriveNTool utility . We recommend upgrading to the new version.   Attention!   InPhoenixMiner already have built-in overclocking support and application timings.   Requirements      OS: Windows 7,8,10 and later builds.   Only AMD graphics cards released under the RX series.   Driver not lower than Crimson 16.6.3 b.    How to use?  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download the program  \t\t \t\t \t\tDownload the program from the official source - overclock.net forum. \t\t   \t\t  \t\t \t  \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Overclock your graphics card  \t\t \t\t \t\t  To do this, follow these steps:   Measure your power consumption and hashrate in regular metrics. Measure power consumption and hashrate by modifying the BIOS. Select the correct core frequency. The value should also be lowered gradually. This will reduce power consumption. The step is 50 hashes. Overclock the card using video memory. Increase the values ​​gradually. First you need to set Power Target = 50. Target Temp. put it on 65. Lower mV consumption. It is worth starting from 1000-1050 mV.         \t\t \t\t \t   \t \t \t \tStep 3 - Find Effective Parameters  \t \t  Repeat the steps to find the desired frequencies until the values ​​reach the most effective. At the same time, watch out for drawdowns by hash rate. The farm must be stable. When you are satisfied with the indicators, press the \"Set\" button.   \t \t  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tVideo instruction  \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Program overview   The performance of GPUs is always locked at a certain rate by the manufacturer. This is done so that the video card does not overheat and meets the declared service life. However, this is extremely inconvenient for miners. They need to increase the power of their graphics hardware. If you have such a problem and you are the owner of an AMD card, we recommend that you pay attention to this program.   Attention!  Vega graphics cards and many others are not supported. To work with such cards, you need MSI Afterburner along with a special BIOS firmware for the video adapter.          Video: Gigabyte rx 480 g1 8gb is cool! Literally [f8 bios]     subscribe   The program is used to monitor the state of graphics processors, adjust the voltage and speed of coolers. The utility allows you to reduce power consumption, power supply load. An ordinary user does not need such functionality. However, it will come in very handy for farm owners. Reducing power consumption will allow you to earn more, reducing the payback period and increasing the duration of the graphics adapters.   The program can also be suitable for those who need to increase the performance of video adapters. Using the client, you can overclock the graphics card by setting the optimal frequency of the video memory and core. In addition, the utility is worth downloading for the sake of increasing the rotational speed of the fan blades. This process is mandatory, since overclocking a video card necessarily leads to increased heating, which ultimately will cause the graphics card to burn out. By default, the utility sets the limit to 90˚C. If necessary, the indicator can be changed. However, this can be done only by realizing the risks of a quick failure of the graphics card.   Alternatives  Is there a version for Nvidia? No, there are alternatives. For example:      Nvidia Inspector   MSI Afterburner   ATI Winflash   Polaris Bios Editor   Features:      Tracking and configuring VRM.   Maintaining profiles.   Changing clock frequencies and voltages.   Changing the voltage of the video memory.   Cooler and power settings.   Standard monitoring with no performance impact.   Access to I2C is provided.   Load line correction.   The ability to scale the current energy consumption.   Voltage variation in the range of -300 … + 300 mV.   Profiles can be passed as arguments via the command line. They can also be loaded and saved through the graphical interface. * For each processor, you can add its own, individually configured profile. Data is entered through the command line.          Video: How to overclock and undervolt rx 580 - adrenalin 2020 easy guide, tutorial:     subscribe   Commands      GPU clock and voltage: works similar to WattMan. Clocks are not restricted to 5 MHz increments, but voltage is limited to 6.25 mV steps (rounding mode is up, so 976 mV will result in 981.25 mV).   Memory clock and voltage: works similar to WattMan. The voltage is not the actual memory voltage (which is fixed to about 1.5 V or needs a hardmod)). The voltage controllers second loop is not used, so it is questionable, whether the memory controller has an own dynamic voltage plane. My guess is that the voltage set here simply is a lower limit for the core voltage. If you overclock the memory, always check for memory errors (can be done with HWiNFO).   Fan and Power settings: nothing special here. Minimum fan rpm is not limited, I can set values below WattMan’s limit of 1040 rpm. Minimum rpm is not used directly. My estimate is that values below 2200 are scaled by 2/3. So 2500 results in 2200 * 2/3 + 300 = 1760 (see screenshot), while 1800 will give 1800 * 2/3 = 1200.   Standard monitoring: these values should be identical to the values displayed in WattMan and there is (almost) no performance impact caused by monitoring.   I2C access: is currently only working for the IR3567B controller on line 4 address 8 on RX470/RX480 cards. Access is synchronized with other tools like GPU-Z or HWiNFO, which can sometimes result in missing readings. I2C access has a large performance impact and causes stuttering (even for dragging a window on the desktop). Changes to I2C settings are not persistent. They will revert to defaults after the VRM is powered down.   VRM monitoring: is disabled by default. Reading the values is not atomic, so VID and VOUT are not always in sync. VDDC resolution is only 7.8 mV.   Load Line Calibration: eliminates voltage drop (on my card i get VOUT = VID +- 1mV). Not actually very useful.   Phase gain: The reference RX 480 has the first three VRM phases connected to the 6-pin connector and the remaining three phases connected to the slot. After reviews measured power draw above 80 W from the slots, AMD implemented a fix that shifts load the 6-pin connector. The default value for this is DDD000 (Hex). The maximum possible shift would be FFF000. Equal load distribution (000000) slightly increases the VRM efficiency. I get about 3°C lower VRM temps with 000000, power savings might be in the 2-3W range. On non-reference cards all/most phases are probably connected to the 8-pin, so changing this setting is pointless.   Current scale: will scale the current reported by the VRM. On the reference RX480 the default value is 60 (hex). If you set it to 20 you will see GPU-Z reporting about half the power draw. This will double the available power, before you reach the power target. But other stuff will also only see half the current. Dont expect over current protection to work with this setting. The encoding of this value is unknown and non-reference cards use different values. If you want to bypass the power limit, it is probably safer to use EMBD or a custom bios (der8auer’s unlocked air bios for reference cards is signed by AMD).   Voltage offset: is available from -300mV to +300mV (not tested over the whole range). The input is decimal and gets multiplied by 6.25mV. So the valid range is -48 to 48.   Troubleshooting   If you find the error “Mutex creation failed”, run the program as administrator. The problem appears when there is a working program that monitors GPUs, for example GPU-Z. In this case, the utility is already acting on behalf of the administrator. Therefore, there are mutual synchronization exceptions. To fix the problem, you need to download and run Wattul as a regular user. Next, you need to close all programs in use, and then restart the utility.   Versions      0.91   0.9   Conclusions   We have identified the following features of the program:      The operating frequencies of both the video memory and the core of AMD graphics cards are being adjusted.   Providing ready-made profiles for all video cards related to the RX series.   You can increase or decrease the voltage transmitted to the GPU.   The fan speed can be monitored.

Typically, users can use the following methods to determine the miner’s IP address:   Log into the router your miners are connecting to (suitable for multiple miners)   Enter the IP address of the router into the address bar of your browser, and then you will see the login page. Make sure your computer is also connected to this router. Click “connected terminals”, then you will see all the equipment that connects to this router. Typically, ASICs with Antminer will display the name with “Antminer”. The list contains the IP address of each terminal. Copy the URL into the address bar.        Note!  In some routers, this setting is called “DHCP” rather than “Device list”.   Use IP Scanner to scan IP (suitable for multiple miners)   If users do not know the IP address of the router, you can download an IP scanner to find out the IP address of the miner.      Connect your computer and miners to the same router.   Press Windows+R together and enter cmd, then enter ipconfig/all and press Enter.   IPv4 address is the IP address of your computer.

XMRig – is a console software that employs special commands to mine cryptocurrencies such as Monero (XMR). For it to work, you need to create a configuration file. The miner works with a processor (CPU) and video cards (AMD and Nvidia). The commission is set in the range from 1 to 5 percent. The default is the maximum value.     XM Rig is free software licensed under the GNU GPL v3.

Use only XMRig console.   Let’s consider the second option. To do this, we need to create a .bat file with the following text:           xmrig –  indicates that this particular program is being launched. This does not need to be changed.   randomx – the parameter indicates which algorithm will be used for mining. If you want to mine Ravencoin using the kawpow algorithm, then register kawpow.   -o - after this parameter, the address of the pool is entered. Indicate the one that you want to use for mining cryptocurrency.   :3380 -  immediately put a colon after the address, and indicate the port number.   -u -  enter the address of the cryptocurrency wallet. You can open it on the cryptocurrency exchange or through crypto wallet programs. Enter 3P7qADz69quhfyK5e9kvfno6Jyjq4Rcocx your Nicehash wallet address instead.   .rig1 - is the name of your device. This is necessary for the convenience of tracking statistics. Any value can be specified.   Example:   xmrig -a randomx -o randomxmonero.eu.nicehash.com:3380 -u 3P7qADz69quhfyK5e9kvfno6Jyjq4Rcocx.rig1 --coin monero  pause   At the end of the batch file, we recommend adding the command pause. It will pause the program if an error occurs. Otherwise, the software just closes. With a pause, you can see the type of error or misspelled syntax and fix the problem.   If you use the Nicehash shell itself:   To reduce the number of mining threads, you need to follow these steps:           Click the Benchmark tab.   Choose your processor and XMRig.   Click on the settings gear.   Find the “Extra Launch Parameters” text box and write down --threads=N, where N is is the number of threads you want to use.   Click the “Enable only this Algorithm” button.   An example of using 8 threads:   --threads=8   An example of reducing CPU usage:   --cpu-priority 0   The command --cpu-priority is responsible for specifying the priority under which the miner will run in the OS. Available Values:      0 - low,   1 - below average,   2 - medium,   3 - above average,   4 - high,   5 - real time (maximum).

Video: CPU Mining Performance Boost - XMRig Tweaks - Followup to Previous Video     subscribe   Xmrig proxy setup   Xmrig-proxy (miner proxy pool) is an additional transmission channel between miners and pools. Xmrig-proxy not only takes on the role of the mining pool, but also takes on the responsibility of the miner. Xmrig-proxy receives tasks from the pool and then assigns them to miners to perform computations (in this sense, it takes on the role of the mining pool).   After the calculation is complete, the miners send the shares to xmrig-proxy, then xmrig-proxy send the data to the mining pool.        So, under what circumstances should xmrig-proxy be used?      Miners with a large number of devices can use xmrig-proxy to centrally manage computing power.   When there are many miners connected to a specific IP address that send shares (solutions) too often, the pool will consider this as a DDoS attack and that IP address will be blocked by the mining pool. At this time, you can install a proxy.   The mining pool is far away and an agent has been added to improve network connectivity.   Xmrig-proxy usage guide:      Download the XMRig Proxy version and unzip it.        After unpacking, you will see two files: xmrig-proxy.exe and config.json (there will also be minor files: SHA256SUMS and start.bat).         Right click to edit the file. Notepad++ editor to edit     The mining port can be used by default, if you have special needs, you can change it yourself. After modification, save and exit.       Double click xmrig-proxy to start it and start the proxy pool service. Look at the interface as in the following figure, it means your agent has been started successfully. You may need to allow it to run. Click “Allow access”.      After successfully launching Xmrig-proxy, we need to change the address of the mining pool IP:PORT to where the xmrig-proxy is located. The rest do not need to be changed.      Change the parameter \"url\": to your IP:        Then run xmrig like below:        You will see all the miners on the network:        How to check hashrate   In the XMrig proxy miner, you can check the hash rate, results and status of video cards. There are two ways to view the data:      Through the console.   via API.   By default, the hash rate is displayed every minute. You can use the command --print-time to change this indicator.        In the miner window, you need to press the following keys:   H - to display the hashrate value. E - to show the performance of the graphics adapter. P - to press pause. R - to resume work.      H – to display the hashrate value.   E – to show the performance of the graphics adapter.   P – to press pause..   R – to resume work.   If the program sends shares to the pool, an alert is shown accepted. In case of problems with the configuration, the system issues rejected.   MSR Mod   MSR Mod – is hardware prefetching to solve fundamental performance problems. RandomX’s algorithm accesses memory randomly, so prefetching just doesn’t work.   Sometimes prefetching can be turned off in BIOS. For Intel, this is usually setting Hardware Prefetcher and adjoining Cache Line Prefetch. However, some MSRs cannot be disabled even in the BIOS. In all the places where prefetching can help, there are already explicit prefetch instructions in your code.   The solution is to set up prefetching using MSRs at the OS level.   If you are running the latest version of XMRig with root (Linux) or Administrator (Windows) rights, the miner automatically configures all MSR registers. If everything is in order, the miner has received all the necessary privileges and your processor supports them, you will see a line as shown below in the miner’s log.   msr register values for \"intel\" preset has been set successfully (16 ms)   Some hardware / software configurations also need to be disabled Secure Boot for the MSR mod to work, check issue #1891 on github.   Supported processors:      Intel (Nehalem, Westmere, Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell, Broadwell and newer).   Ryzen (all Zen-based processors: Ryzen, Threadripper, EPYC).   XMRig restores the original MSR values ​​by default on exit, in any case the changes are not saved, restarting the computer will always discard any changes.   Performance tuning   There “randomx” are 2 options available for configuration in an object:      \"rdmsr\"   \"wrmsr\"   Option rdmsr:  Use \"rdmsr\": false to disable initial MSR recovery on exit.   Option WRMSR:  \"wrmsr\": true (default) Enable the feature MSRor. Use \"wrmsr\": false to disable the MSR feature.   WRMSR number:  \"wrmsr\": 15 Available for Intel only. The default 15 for Intel is generally good, but may not be better, see discussion № 1433 on github.   WRMSR array:  A very advanced format for fine tuning. Use with care.

Has high performance.   The miner officially supports Windows.   Supports the RandomX algorithm, which was adopted by the popular digital coin Monero.   The program also works with NiceHash service.   Apart from RandomX, the software also runs on CryptoNight.   The program uses the CUDA plugin for the miner. Used in separate versions of the program. It is optional and therefore not included in the main software. Moreover, this technology is demanding on the compiler version, and therefore conflicts often arise with the processor code.   Doesn’t work?   The efficiency of mining digital tokens depends on the correct setting of the miner. If you enter the parameters incorrectly, then the program simply will not start or generate an error. However, when using the advanced configuration: adjusting the parameters of the video card, core frequency, etc., then there is a risk of faster wear of the equipment.   If launch is still not possible, visit thematic forums. Most of the problems have already been discussed and have a solution. The main thing is to correctly enter your query into the search engine.

XMRig is not malware. This is a legal cryptocurrency mining program.   However, many malware creators and operators of large botnets embed xmrig-cuda.dll in their malware in order to use other people’s computers to mine cryptocurrency without their permission. This is why antivirus software treats XMRig as malware due to the large number of computers infected with malware associated with it.   Total:      If you downloaded the program yourself from the official source on Github or xmrig.com, then there is nothing to worry about.   If you have never downloaded this program yourself, uninstall it immediately.   Therefore, some antivirus scanners consider the program to be malicious because antiviruses do not distinguish between intentional (conscious) mining and hidden mining (when cryptocurrency is mined without your knowledge). In the latter case, you need to remove the program from the system.   How to remove?   If the virus has recently begun to act, then go to the system folder and look at the date the files were modified, you will find. Manually deleted like this: Shift + Delete.   If you downloaded the program yourself, then just delete it as you usually delete files.          Video: Xmrig.exe Virus Removal Guide     subscribe   This video will show you how to remove Xmrig.exe from your computer. If you still need help we have a detailed guide to help you with all the steps.   Frequent problems   Users from time to time may have various problems with the miner. Some are associated with drivers, others with the peculiarities of the algorithm.   For example, an error with the algorithm looks like this wrong algo, use randomx miner. It occurs when the wrong syntax of the algorithm is entered or it was not possible to change it. Also, the problem may appear due to strong overclocking of the video card.   The problem low difficulty share speaks of an incorrectly matched pool port. Assignments come with erroneous difficulty. Choose a pool based on your hardware. Please note that for a farm with high-performance cards, medium-performance processors, and just one card or home computer, different port categories are issued.   The error cryptonight_extra_cpu_finak indicates a system overload. Therefore, you need to reduce the size of streams and blocks.

Save the current BIOS as described in the ATIFlash instructions.         Or save the BIOS .rom file in the TechPowerUp GPU-Z.        Alternatively: use other programs like ATITool and RivaTuner, they can also save BIOS from the card. However, these programs still have problems with the latest graphics cards.   \t\t \t\t \t   \t \t \t \tStep 3 - optimize for mining  \t \t Run MorePowerTool.exe as administrator. To do this, right-click.      Click the \"Load\" button and load the BIOS version you saved in the previous step. In the selection window, select the BIOS file with the extension .rom. You can also open any other BIOS found on the Internet.      In the field above, select your GPU.      Now we set the \"Overdrive Limits\". This influences the specifications of the sliders and their maximum values in the Wattman.      Next we set the \"Power and Voltage\". This also influences the specifications of the the maximum values in the Wattman for the Frequency/Voltage slider and the Power Limit. The \"Current\" setting TDCI can be set only here, not in Wattman!      Next we set the \"Frequencies\". This also influences the specifications of the values in the Wattman for the combined Frequency/Voltage slider and the memory clock rate as real preset.      Finally, we can change the fan curves necessary. But much more important is the saving with \"Save\" into the MPT settings file with the changed PowerPlayTables. Don't use \"Write SPPT\" or \"Delete SPPT\"!      We reload the saved BIOS, because this serves as template for the new BIOS. To do this, we use a bunch of programs: Red Bios Editor (RBE) + MorePowerTool.  Run Red BIOS Editor.exe. Open the BIOS with the \"Load\" button. Want to display a new boot message? Why not personalize it? Change sub-vendor and GPU ID!      Now we can load the saved PowerPlayTables from the MorePowerTool into the new BIOS.      The new VRAM settings are more tricky. Only change something here if you are really sure what you are doing! Besides the timing strings you can also select other modules (manufacturer). But be careful as always!      We can now save our new BIOS into an own ROM file!      Now we need to flash the BIOS Back to the card!  We need an adapted Flash tool. Follow the instructions for ATIFlash firmware.   If you increased the settings carefully, you don't need any further overclocking. But if you need more power, let's have a look at the Wattman!    Higher GFX clock rate. More GFX voltage. Power limit enlarged. and a lot more things behind the GUI.             \t \t  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tVideo Guide  \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Mining guide   You can find the original AMD firmware on the TechPowerUp website.

Because AMD has closed the door for increasing the power limit and voltage specifications in Wattman, you have to ultimately set the TGP and the TDC in MPT, i.e. the maximum power for the GPU and memory along with the maximum upper limit for the flowing currents. Here you should act very carefully, as long as you can’t estimate in detail yourself and know how the board really reacts. For the RX 6800 the normal XT-BIOS is completely sufficient, because the preset 255 Watt or 300 A for the TDC are easily enough for a complete power consumption of 300 Watt (and a little more).    subscribe   &nbsp;  &nbsp;          AMD hid the true power of the RX 5700... here's how to unlock it  The RX 5700's performance has been artificially locked by AMD.

Also if using –gpu-id parameter always set it as the first –gpu.. parameter, then set the rest (–gpu-intensity .. etc..)   When setting any of the parameters don’t use “ or ‘ around the value!   Parameters that take a TIME value must be set in SECONDS!   Conclusions   It is impossible to get cryptocurrency without special programs. Therefore, we recommend that you pay attention to one of the best programs and download SRBMiner multi. The software works with video cards from AMD Radeon, supporting most of the versions released by this manufacturer: from VEGA to RX and R9. The program supports various cryptocurrency mining algorithms. It is especially popular with Ethereum miners.

Fixed display of hashrate while doing gpu auto tune process.   Changed GPU temperature to show edge value instead of hotspot.   0.8.3      Performance increase on ‘heavyhash’ algorithm for GPU’s (up to ~20% on some cards)   Fixed issue with recognising some GPU’s on newer drivers (broken since v0.8.1)   Reworked hashrate reporting/stats - now reporting average for 1 min / 1 hr / 6 hr / 12 hr (in API too)   0.8.2     Added possibility to preload dataset/s on ‘autolykos2’ algorithm with ‘--gpu-autolykos2-preload’ parameter (even on 4Gb cards!)   Little faster dataset creation on some GPU’s   Job notifications are now displayed in console less frequently, unless extended log is enabled   Reverted ‘autolykos2’ kernels for hawaii, tonga and fiji to the ones from ver. 0.7.3 Dataset preloading can increase pool-side hashrate! (that means more profit) Works even on GPU’s with 4Gb! For example if you set to preload 1 dataset that means it will create the dataset for the current and next block. When the next block arrives, dataset will get loaded, which means GPU can continue working immediately (without creating the dataset). Additional GPU memory needed.   There are 2 types of preloading:     If you set preload value to 1 it will constantly keep preloading the next block (preferred for 4-8GB gpu’s)   If you set preload value to &gt; 1 it will preload X number of datasets, and when a block arrives that isn’t yet loaded, it will be created so miner can start working on it, and then again X number of datasets will get preloaded.   0.8.1     Added algorithm firopow (FIRO - Firo coin), fee 0.85%;   Added algorithm kawpow (RVN - Raven coin), fee 0.85%;   Added algorithm progpow_sero (SERO - Super Zero coin), fee 0.85%;   Added algorithm progpow_veil (VEIL - Veil coin), fee 0.85%;   Added algorithm progpow_zano (ZANO - Zano coin), fee 0.85%;   Added algorithm progpow_veriblock (VBK - Veriblock coin), fee 0.85%;   Added algorithm progpow_epic (EPIC - EpicCash coin), fee 0.85%;   Small improvements on autolykos2 algorithm for RX550 &amp; RX560 GPU’s;   Added shares statistics per GPU (accepted / rejected / gpu validation errors) *@Mr.Archer note “console output only”;   Added parameter --gpu-progpow-mode (which progpow program to use);   Added parameter --gpu-progpow-preload (how many periods to pre-create);   Fixed crashing on Ryzen 3000 series CPU’s on ‘autolykos2’ algorithm;   Fixed compatibility with p2p-spb.xyz P2P pools;   Fixed ‘Internet not found’ issue on some linux distributions;   Changed default value for --max-no-submit-responses parameter from 0 to 5;   Renamed parameter --disable-gpu-watchdog to --disable-worker-watchdog;   To fix miner disconnects on ‘autolykos2’ with ‘WoolyPooly’ pool, try –keepalive true;   Minor bug fixes;   Progpow algos are using single DAG allocation (no split DAG), so you need a driver that allows allocation of large buffers.   --gpu-progpow-mode is auto selected, but you can test manually, maybe you find a mode that works better for your GPU  ","categories": ["miners"],

        "excerpt":"               AMDMemoryTweak: Download from the official site and change Memory Timing Level.          In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up and use the latest AMD Memory Tweak v0.2.3 and newer.   Download for Windows / Linux        Download AMDMemoryTweak (GitHub) Download AMDMemoryTweakXL version       What is AMD Memory Tweak?     AMD Memory Tweak - is a new open source tool introduced by Eliovp and A. Solodovnikov. It is a tool that allows you to change graphics card memory timings on the fly like ETHlargementPill, but for AMD. This tool is also compatible with Vega. Works from the command line only.    AMDMemoryTweakXL - This version has a graphical shell. Works similar to your typical graphics card overclocking software such as MSI Afterburner, EVGA Precision XOC or Asus GPU Tweak II. However, Elievp and Solodovnikov’s program primarily focuses on the memory aspect, so it has more advanced features, one of which is the ability to adjust memory timings on the fly.   System requirements      OS: Windows 10 / Windows 8 / Windows 7 / Windows Vista / XP and Linux.   Driver: At least Radeon Software Adrenalin 19.4.1 (and AMDGPU-Pro for Linux).   Driver: At least Radeon Software Adrenalin 19.4.1 (and AMDGPU-Pro for Linux).   Supported Graphics Cards   The authors did not provide a compatibility list, but the program should work with a wide range of AMD Radeon graphics cards, ranging from older models with GDDR5 memory to the latest offerings with HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) and HBM2 memory.    How to use AMD Memory Tweak  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - download the software  \t\t \t\t \t\tDownload the program from the official developer repository - GitHub.. \t\t   \t\t  \t\tThe version for Windows is called WinAMDTweak.exe. However, you need to download all files (IOMap64.sys, IOMap.sys) and place them in one folder.  \t\t   \t\t \t  \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - launch AMD Memory Tweak  \t\t \t\t \t\t To work with the utility, you need to study the timings of the available video memory and create a file with the .bat extension with their optimal values ​​for mining.  To find out the current values ​​of the timings, enter the command in the batch file:  WinAMDTweak.exe --current pause        The performance of the video memory increases with decreasing latency. We need to lower the timing values ​​and apply them with this software. Keep in mind that video memory from different manufacturers (Samsung, Hynix, Micron, Elpida) have individual characteristics of overclocking timings (lines).       \t\t \t\t \t   \t \t \t \tStep 3 - change timings via bat file  \t \t \t For the Vega 56 video card with Hynix video memory, the timings will be as follows:   WinAMDTweak.exe --RAS 24 --RCDRD 19 --RCDWR 4 --RC 35 --RP 13 --RRDS 4 --RRDL 5 --RFC 148 --REF 15600   The launch is performed on the .bat file you created.   Since the timings are applied on the fly, in the event of a reboot, you will have to execute the command again. In order not to perform it every time, configure the batch file autoloading.  To autostart, put your .bat shortcut to Windows Startup. The startup folder in the Windows 10 operating system is located in the following path: C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup  Example for Samsung video memory:  WinAMDTweak.exe --ras 26 --rcdrd 13 --rcdwr 12 --rc 38 --rp 12 --rrds 3 --rrdl 5 --rtp 6 --faw 12 -- cwl 8 --wtrs 4 --wtrl 9 --wr 13 --ref 24000 --rfc 239      \t \t  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tVideo guide  \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Attention!  Miners PhoenixMiner and NBMiner already have a ready-made and built-in timing setting. Read about NBMiner and PhoenixMiner.   AMD Memory Tweak XL   As already mentioned, the XL version, unlike the usual one (CLI), has a graphical shell (GUI):        In it, you can make settings directly in the program window:        It is better to run the software as an administrator.   For GPUs of the Polaris family, add the parameter:   --REF 30   &nbsp;          Hive os - RX Boost - AmdMemTweak   I stopped the miner, then I go to Overclocking and here on this screen, there's a new parameter \"Mem tweak\". We suggest you put the value of 30 here, then click Save implies, this Overclocking ok. Then I start miner again. MD settings applied. We wait for the miner to settings up.

RX 5700   For RX 5700 this tool does not work. The developer of this tool opened his own production of rigs based on the 5700 with his own operating system.   NAVI and GDDR6 video memory   On GDDR6, the parameter is written --REF 30 in the timings when editing the BIOS. It is important to set it from 9000 to 16000. Changing timings on the fly for GDDR6 is locked.   In any case, NAVI will work the same as Vega 56/64. The memory bandwidth is the same. GDDR6 will perform slightly better due to tighter timings compared to HBM. The main result will be energy savings compared to the Vega.   Note!  RBE has fully decoded GDDR6 timings. Over 100 different sling timings. A stability of 60+ MH should be readily achievable.   RX 470/480/570/570X/580/580X/590   Use PhoenixMiner timings for these video cards.   Since with Polaris cards, you can use a bios mod or a miner that changes the timings itself.

A GUI utility that runs on Windows and Linux, not only allows you to overclock your AMD Radeon graphics card on the fly, but also tweak the memory timings. Most timings are applied in real time, but some require a reboot. Unfortunately, this means that they cannot be changed yet, as a reboot resets the timings to their default values. Of course, the utility allows you to change the frequency of the GPU core and control the operation of the fans.        &nbsp;          Low Power 51Mh/s Vega 64 With AMD Memory Tweaker!

Just make a few changes and click the \"inject\" button, then \"refresh from driver\", (the values ​​in the dropdown are the values ​​loaded from vbios in memory), if you click the \"refresh\" button, the tool will load the values ​​from the driver directly.               Conclusions   Most of the settings are in real time. However, some of the demanding memory timings may require a system reboot to be applied correctly.   Essentially, the modified BIOS will simply hard-code the memory timing, frequency, and voltage. But you can also apply them on the fly with OC and amdmemtweak.   So the graphics cards have a stock version of the BIOS in case of resale.   If you are mining on video cards, then it is recommended to use PhoenixMiner.   ","categories": ["tools"],

To start mining Ethereum using a Nanominer, you just need to enter your wallet into the configuration or batch file.    How to run Nanominer through a bat file  \t \t \t \t\tStep 1 - Download Nanominer  \t\t Nanopool provides a link to download Nanominer:   on GitHub and on the official website.       Go to the GitHub repository. Find \"Assets\":    Download the most recent ZIP archive for Windows 10 or your other operating system. Unpack the downloaded archive to a convenient place (for example, on the Desktop).       \t\t \t \t \t \t \t\tStep 2 - Configure Nanominer  \t\t \t\t After you have unpacked the archive, you will see the configuration files .ini. You need to edit these default config files or create a .bat file.        Let's start with the .bat file. In the same folder as nanominer.exe, you need to create a file with the extension .bat.   Just copy any .ini file and give it the extension .bat.   Open the .bat file with Notepad. Below is an example of a setup for Ethereum. You need to add the following commands to it:   helper_scripts/cmdline_launcher -algo ethash -coin eth -pool1 ethash.poolbinance.com:8888 -wallet username1 -rigName RIG_ID pause    Instead, username1 just insert your username from the Binance Pool.    \t\t \t\t \t \t \t \t \tStep 3 - start Nanominer  \t After everything is done in step 2, you are ready to mine. All that's left to do is launch the miner and then go to the Binance Pool, where you can track your mining progress.   The program is launched in a standard way: double-click the left mouse button on the file with the extension .bat. After starting, a window opens indicating all the entered parameters.         \t \t  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tVideo guide  \t \t \t \t subscribe \t     Setting up via Config using Ravencoin as an example   An alternative launch option would be setting instead of a batch file through a configuration file. It has the extension .ini   By default, the program reads the settings from a file config.ini and runs through nanominer.exe.   Listing of the configured file for Ravencoin:   ; Address to send funds to. Change this address to yours! wallet = RAXCRKF2JdYwYLn2RiMxDPNgvKMwfVrjY9  ; Coin to mine. coin = RVN  ; (Optional) Rig (worker) name. rigName = speed_test   In the config file, you need to change three things:      wallet - insert here the address of your wallet from the mined cryptocurrency.   coin - indicate the ticker of the coin (usually it is displayed on the exchange). Leave RVN for Ravencoin.   rigName - specify the name of the worker (your mining rig).   Here’s what we should get:           Double click the file nanominer.exe in the Nanominer folder.   A window will appear showing the progress of the miner as he connects to the pool, adjusts a few more parameters and starts mining. On Windows it will look something like the window below.      That’s it, you mine RVN from Nanopool with Nanominer!   Now let’s check our Nanopool progress. Visit nanopool.org in a web browser.   Click RavenCoin on the main page.   In the upper right corner of the page, paste your wallet address and click Search.     You will receive either a page with statistics for your mining farm, or a page where no account was found, which (assuming your wallet was configured correctly) means that you have to wait until your farm finds a few shares (solutions).      We are waiting for the cannon to report Total shares at least 1.      We update the page that reported “Account Not Found” and see that the statistics have appeared:      After mining another ten minutes, a graph with a hash rate will appear.   Mine on Nvidia?

Reboot   restarts - the parameter sets the number of miner restarts before restarting the farm. In case of problems with the video card, such as hardware errors or lagging, or if the hash rate drops (if the minhashrate option is used), nanominer will restart. However, some errors cannot be corrected by restarting the program. In such cases, you need to reboot the rig. To reboot, the miner loads the script reboot.bat from the current directory, if it is running on Windows, or reboot.sh if on Linux.   For Windows:   shutdown /r /t 5 /f   For Linux:   reboot   Troubleshooting   Having problems? There are only a few things that can really go wrong. They include:   First, give the software ten or fifteen minutes before claiming something went wrong. After we found our first share, our wallet address does not display the statistics page for ten minutes.   If you have waited more than 15 minutes and still do not see the mining statistics page, check the following:      One or more values ​​were incorrectly set in the file .ini.   You have inserted the wrong wallet address when searching.   There is something wrong with your mining rig.   The nanopool does not work.   Next steps:      There are many more options available for T-rex Miner. To find out more, read the setup instructions.   If you haven’t already, try overclocking your video cards to increase the hashrate.

On the MiniZ website, you can choose to download cuda 8 or cuda 10. Cuda 10 is for newer drivers, 411.31 or newer. If you have a 10 series GPU with older drivers, download Cuda 8. Be aware that a newer RTX version (20 series) will not work on Cuda 8. You can try both Cuda 8 and 10 for GTX (series ten).   To start saving logs for miniZ, add a parameter --log to the mining configuration.   Having problems? There are many more options available for T-rex Miner.

Yes. The Team Black miner was added on 22th October 2021.                 What is the best pools for this miner?                         Since, TBM can produce more than 1-2 % stales with high intensity (--xintensity), pools that reward stale shares is the best for this miner.             Also a high difficulty pool port is recomended with a high intensity setting.             Note that the ethereum blockchain rewards stale work/blocks. They are called uncle blocks. The uncle blocks are protecting the security of the blockchain.             The ethereum blockchain pay 87.5% for level 1 stale shares. 6 levels of stale shares are payed, but the lower levels have a lower payout (lower level means later in time).             Most mining pools reward stale work, but some have a buildt in limit of 5% allowed stales. So if you mine with more than 5% stales, the pools can start rejecting your shares or ignore them.             Good pools for TBMiner:                         miningpoolhub (100% reward for level 1 stale shares)             2miners (100% reward for level 1 stale shares)             nanopool (100% reward for level 1 stale shares)             woolypooly (100% reward for level 1 stale shares)             antpool (100% reward for  level 1 stale shares)             spiderpool (100% reward for  level 1 stale shares)             f2pool (100% reward for level 1 stale shares)             uupool (100% reward for level 1 stale shares)             xnpool.com (100% reward for level 1 stale shares)             ezil (70% reward for stale shares)             hiveon (50% reward for stale shares)                                     What is the best --xintensity --dagintensity and --kernel setting?                         You can try for yourself or ask others. Different GPU cards might have different best settings, both with OC and the intensity setting. And the pool is important.             High --xintensity, higher amout of stale shares, higher speed.             Some pools doesn’t pay for stales so the setting is pool dependent.             --dagintensity: 1-8(9) is for high memclocks. Use when dag buffer crash on validation. 1 is low (slow dag) 8 on amd is the fastest,  9 on nvidia (0 is default).             --kernel: Different kernels can give a speedup on different models. Your power setting can also count. Autotune will try to find the fastest kernel for you.                       NVIDIA cards:             Miners have reported that --xintensity 3100 and  --xintensity 4096 works good on f2pool.com and 2miners.com             AMD cards:             AMD intensity settings  are 1/4 of NVIDIA.             For no stale shares use something like --xintensity 24 or --xintensity 8 (flexpool, crazypool, nicehash).             -- xintensity -1 is good on miningpoolhub, nanopool, f2pool and 2miners.                          --xintensity 60 works good on the RX 580.             --xintensity 78 works good on the 6800XT.                                     It says the pool is not supported?               Ask us to add it. We will configure the miner.                 The miner produce stales?                           Yes it might. You can lower the intensity setting (--xintensity) to reduce stale shares.               With the right settings you could have none.               But you can also see stale shares as an extra bonus to accepted shares if you use a pool that pays for stale shares.                      What boards are known to be good for this miner?              A lot, mostly the new cards.  Nvidia RTX series 20xx, 30xx and Amd series 5xxx, 6xxx are known to work very well with this miner.                TBMiner exits with message dag verification failed?                             Add the commandline option --dagintensity with a low value to prevent computing errors with high OC.                 If it still exits with the message, try lowering OC.                               Is it a computer virus?              No. No way. But viruses are known to exploit coin mining for profit.                It is not working, why?                             See Install Windows or Install Linux.                 If it is still not working please submit an issue at Github.                                    Conclusion         Thanks for reading to the end. Bookmark my site in your browser. Happy mining.         Versions         1.28                  Improved performance for AMD cards on ETH+ZIL (dagger cache). (+1-2%).         Added the possibility to mine to ip adresses directly instead of hostnames.         Disable cpu verification with --no-cpu set (default).         Fixed Hashrate/W in the stats for opencl rigs.         Added --maintainance-wallet adress (Mine to another wallet xx% of the time.).         Added --maintainance-percent (Set the % chance to use the maintainance-wallet for the whole session.).         Slower dag generation on --dagintensity 1 to be stable on higher clocks.         Reduced rejected/invalid shares on the ezil.me and the hiveon.io pool. (+1-4%).               1.27                  Removed OpenCL support for Nvidia devices.         Uptime minutes is now accurate.         Stratum connect rewritten to solve libcurl error.               1.26                  Added --lhr-unlock option that can give a +20% boost on nvidia lhr cards with lower power.         Reduced invalid shares on hiveon pool and possibly other ethereum stratum 1.0 pools.         Faster reconnect to pool if pool does not resolve or is not available.         --xintensity 24 default on ethermine for AMD cards.         Fixed memleak in the dag cache code when mining ETH+ZIL               1.25                  Added stats for Amd cards (Linux).         Fixed issue with connect to pool. (Windows).         Don’t add hashrate when validating dag (AMD).         Tiny speedup on NVIDIA cards.         Added a --miningtime option to stop mining after num minutes.         --timeout function now restarts stratum thread after num seconds without data from pool.         Default xintensity on hiveon and binance changed to 24 to reduce stales (AMD)              ","categories": ["miners"],
